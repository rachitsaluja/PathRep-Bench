To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the TNM (Tumor, Node, Metastasis) classification.

1. **Primary Tumor (pT)**: The report indicates that there are two primary tumors:
   - The first tumor in the lingula is 1 cm in size.
   - The second tumor in the left lower lobe is 3.5 cm in size. According to the AJCC classification, a tumor greater than 3 cm but less than or equal to 5 cm is classified as pT2a.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN)**: The report states that there are no regional lymph node metastases (0/4 lymph nodes positive for carcinoma). This is classified as pN0.

3. **Distant Metastases (pM)**: The report indicates that there are no distant metastases, which is classified as pM0.

Now, we can summarize the findings:
- The largest tumor (3.5 cm) is classified as pT2a.
- There are no regional lymph node metastases (pN0).
- There are no distant metastases (pM0).

According to the AJCC staging system:
- Stage I is defined as a tumor that is confined to the lung and has no lymph node involvement.
- Stage II includes tumors that are larger or have spread to nearby lymph nodes.
- Stage III indicates more extensive lymph node involvement or local invasion.
- Stage IV indicates distant metastasis.

Given that the largest tumor is classified as pT2a, with no lymph node involvement (pN0) and no distant metastasis (pM0), this fits the criteria for **Stage II**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
1,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key findings related to the tumor's characteristics, specifically the T (tumor), N (nodes), and M (metastasis) classifications.

1. **Tumor Size and Local Invasion (T)**: The report indicates that the tumor is an adenocarcinoma located in the right lower lobe of the lung, with a size of 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.6 cm. It also states that there is pleural invasion, meaning the tumor has invaded the pleura, which is significant for staging. According to AJCC staging, a tumor that is between 3 cm or less and has pleural invasion is classified as T2.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N)**: The report indicates that all examined lymph nodes (R lymph node, L lymph node, Station 11 lymph node, Station 12 lymph node, and Station 7 lymph node) are negative for neoplasm. This means there is no regional lymph node involvement, which classifies the N status as N0.

3. **Metastasis (M)**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, which implies that the M status is M0.

Based on the findings:
- T2 (tumor size and pleural invasion)
- N0 (no lymph node involvement)
- M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC staging system, the combination of T2, N0, and M0 corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
2,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer based on the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the TNM classification provided in the report.

1. **Primary Tumor (pT)**: The report indicates that the primary tumor is classified as pT1b. According to AJCC staging, pT1b refers to a tumor that is greater than 2 cm but less than or equal to 3 cm in greatest dimension. This fits the description of the tumor, which is 2.8 cm.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN)**: The report states that there is 1 out of 17 lymph nodes involved (pN1). This indicates that there is regional lymph node involvement, which is significant for staging. In AJCC staging, pN1 indicates that there is metastasis to nearby lymph nodes.

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM)**: The report indicates pMX, which means that the presence of distant metastasis cannot be assessed. This does not confirm any distant spread of the cancer.

Now, we can summarize the findings:
- The tumor is classified as pT1b (2.8 cm).
- There is regional lymph node involvement classified as pN1 (1 out of 17 nodes involved).
- There is no evidence of distant metastasis (pMX).

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system for lung cancer:
- Stage I is characterized by no lymph node involvement (pN0).
- Stage II is characterized by pT1 or pT2 with pN1 involvement.
- Stage III is characterized by more extensive lymph node involvement (pN2 or pN3).
- Stage IV is characterized by distant metastasis (pM1).

Given that the patient has a pT1b and pN1, this corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
3,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key findings in the report:

1. **Tumor Size and Extent of Invasion**: The maximum tumor size is reported as 2.5 cm, and it is classified as pT1, which indicates a tumor that is 3 cm or less in greatest dimension and is confined to the lung.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes**: The report indicates that 10 out of 12 lymph nodes are involved by metastatic carcinoma, specifically mentioning involvement of the subcarinal lymph node (pN2). This indicates that there is regional lymph node involvement.

3. **Distant Metastasis**: The report states pMX, which means that distant metastasis cannot be assessed. There is no indication of distant spread in the report.

4. **Margins**: All margins (bronchial, vascular, pleural) are negative, which is a positive finding for the patient.

5. **Lymphatic Invasion**: There is extensive lymphatic invasion noted, which is significant in staging.

Based on the AJCC staging system:
- **Stage I**: Tumor confined to the lung without lymph node involvement.
- **Stage II**: Tumor with local lymph node involvement (N1).
- **Stage III**: Tumor with more extensive regional lymph node involvement (N2 or N3).
- **Stage IV**: Distant metastasis present.

Given that the tumor is classified as pT1 and there is significant regional lymph node involvement (pN2), this aligns with the criteria for **Stage III** cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
4,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key findings related to the tumor's characteristics and staging criteria.

1. **Tumor Size and Local Invasion**: The report indicates that the tumor measures 2.7 cm in greatest dimension and invades the visceral pleura. According to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer, this would classify the tumor as pT2a, which is defined as a tumor greater than 3 cm but less than or equal to 5 cm that invades the visceral pleura.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report states that the regional lymph nodes (Level V lymph node) were examined and found to be negative for metastatic carcinoma (pN0). This means there is no regional lymph node involvement.

3. **Distant Metastasis**: The report indicates that there is no distant metastasis (M0).

4. **Stage Determination**: Based on the AJCC 7th edition criteria:
   - **Stage I**: Tumor confined to the lung without lymph node involvement.
   - **Stage II**: Tumor size greater than 3 cm or with visceral pleural invasion, but with no lymph node involvement.
   - **Stage III**: Involvement of regional lymph nodes.
   - **Stage IV**: Distant metastasis.

Given that the tumor is classified as pT2a (2.7 cm, visceral pleura invasion) and pN0 (no lymph node involvement), the appropriate stage is Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
5,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key findings related to the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis.

1. **Primary Tumor (pT)**: The report indicates that the tumor is classified as pT1b, which means it is greater than 2 cm but less than or equal to 3 cm in greatest dimension. This classification falls under Stage I according to AJCC staging criteria.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN)**: The report states that there are no regional lymph node metastases (pN0). This means that the cancer has not spread to nearby lymph nodes, which is consistent with Stage I.

3. **Distant Metastases (pM)**: The report indicates that there are no distant metastases (pM0), which is also consistent with Stage I.

Given these findings:
- The tumor is invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma measuring 2.5 cm.
- There is no lymph node involvement.
- There are no distant metastases.

Based on the AJCC staging system, the combination of a pT1b tumor, pN0, and pM0 indicates that the cancer is classified as Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
6,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key findings regarding the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and any distant metastasis.

1. **Tumor Size and Location**: The report indicates that there is an invasive grade 3 adenocarcinoma forming a centrally located mass in the right lower lobe measuring 5 x 4 x 3 cm. This size is significant and suggests that the tumor is larger than 3 cm.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report mentions that one of the six intrapulmonary peribronchial lymph nodes is positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma. This indicates that there is regional lymph node involvement (N1), which is a critical factor in staging.

3. **Distant Metastasis**: The report does not indicate any distant metastasis, as it only discusses local and regional lymph nodes and does not mention any other organs being involved.

Based on the AJCC staging system for lung cancer:
- **Stage I**: Tumor ≤ 3 cm, no lymph node involvement.
- **Stage II**: Tumor > 3 cm or any size with local lymph node involvement (N1).
- **Stage III**: More extensive lymph node involvement (N2 or N3) or larger tumor size.
- **Stage IV**: Distant metastasis.

Given that the tumor is larger than 3 cm and there is involvement of regional lymph nodes (N1), the appropriate stage for this cancer is **Stage II**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
7,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key findings:

1. **Tumor Size**: The tumor is described as having a greatest diameter of 2.3 cm. According to AJCC staging, a tumor size of 2-3 cm typically falls into the T1 category.

2. **Tumor Location**: The tumor is located in the right lung lower lobe, which is consistent with lung cancer staging.

3. **Visceral Pleural Invasion**: The report states that the carcinoma extends up to but not through the visceral pleura. This indicates that there is no invasion through the pleura, which is an important factor in staging.

4. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report indicates that there are no metastatic carcinoma cells identified in the examined lymph nodes (0/2 and 0/3), which means there is no regional lymph node involvement.

5. **Final Staging**: The report concludes with a pTN stage of pT1b N0, which corresponds to a tumor size of 2.3 cm (T1b) and no lymph node involvement (N0).

Based on the AJCC staging system:
- Stage I is characterized by T1 tumors (≤3 cm) with no lymph node involvement (N0).
- Stage II typically involves larger tumors or lymph node involvement.
- Stage III and IV involve more advanced disease with significant lymph node involvement or distant metastasis.

Given that the tumor is classified as pT1b N0, it fits the criteria for Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
8,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer based on the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key findings regarding the tumor and lymph node involvement.

1. **Tumor Size and Location**: The report indicates that the tumor is an invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma located in the right upper lobe, with a size of 3.5 cm. 

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report states that there is metastatic adenocarcinoma involving 1 out of 4 hilar lymph nodes. Other lymph nodes (R4, right mainstem bronchus, R9, and station 7) were negative for carcinoma.

3. **Surgical Margins**: The surgical margins, including the bronchial resection margin, are reported as negative for carcinoma, which is a favorable finding.

4. **Pleural Involvement**: The report indicates that there is no pleural involvement, which is also a significant factor in staging.

5. **AJCC Staging Criteria**: 
   - **Stage I**: Tumor ≤ 3 cm, no lymph node involvement.
   - **Stage II**: Tumor > 3 cm, no lymph node involvement or local lymph node involvement.
   - **Stage III**: Any size tumor with regional lymph node involvement.
   - **Stage IV**: Distant metastasis.

Given that the tumor is 3.5 cm (which is greater than 3 cm) and there is involvement of 1 hilar lymph node, this indicates regional lymph node involvement. Therefore, the cancer cannot be classified as Stage I or Stage II.

Since there is regional lymph node involvement but no distant metastasis or pleural involvement, the most appropriate classification is Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
9,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the details regarding the tumor's characteristics and its involvement with surrounding structures.

1. **Tumor Size and Local Invasion**: The tumor in the left lower lobe measures approximately 50 x 60 x 45 mm. It is described as invasive, with features indicating it closely abuts the pleural surface but does not show definite invasion of the pleura. There are small satellite deposits of tumor in the adjacent lung parenchyma, which suggests local spread.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report indicates that there are no metastases to the hilar lymph nodes, which is significant. The N classification (N0) indicates no regional lymph node involvement.

3. **Distant Metastasis**: The report does not mention any distant metastasis, which would be classified as M0.

4. **AJCC Staging**: Based on the AJCC staging system:
   - **Stage I**: Tumor ≤ 3 cm (T1) or > 3 cm but not invading pleura or lymph nodes (T2a).
   - **Stage II**: Tumor > 3 cm (T2b) or any size with local invasion (T3) but no lymph node involvement (N0).
   - **Stage III**: Involvement of regional lymph nodes (N1, N2, or N3).
   - **Stage IV**: Distant metastasis (M1).

Given that the tumor is invasive, measures more than 3 cm, and there is no lymph node involvement (N0), it fits the criteria for Stage II. The absence of pleural invasion and no distant metastasis further supports this classification.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
10,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key components of the report in relation to the AJCC staging criteria for lung adenocarcinoma.

1. **Tumor Size**: The tumor measures 3 cm in greatest dimension. According to AJCC staging, a tumor size of 3 cm typically falls into the T1 category.

2. **Tumor Extent**: The report indicates that the tumor extends to the visceral pleura. This suggests that the tumor is not confined to the lung parenchyma alone, which is a critical factor in staging. Tumors that invade the visceral pleura are classified as T2.

3. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report states that there is 1 out of 1 lymph node positive for metastasis. This indicates that there is regional lymph node involvement, which is classified as N1 in AJCC staging.

4. **Distant Metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, which suggests that the cancer has not spread beyond the regional lymph nodes.

Based on the above analysis:
- The tumor is classified as T2 (due to visceral pleura involvement).
- The lymph node involvement is classified as N1.
- There is no evidence of distant metastasis (M0).

According to the AJCC staging system, the combination of T2, N1, and M0 corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
11,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key components of the report:

1. **Tumor Size and Local Extent (pT)**: The report indicates ""pT2,"" which means the tumor is larger than 3 cm but not larger than 5 cm. This suggests a moderate local extent of the tumor.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN)**: The report states ""pNO (0/20),"" indicating that there is no regional lymph node involvement (0 out of 20 lymph nodes examined are positive for cancer). This is a critical factor as it suggests that the cancer has not spread to nearby lymph nodes.

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM)**: The report shows ""pMx,"" which means that the presence of distant metastasis is unknown. However, it does not indicate any known distant spread.

4. **Grade (G2)**: The tumor is graded as G2, which indicates a moderately differentiated tumor. While this provides information about the tumor's aggressiveness, it does not directly affect the staging.

Now, we can summarize the findings:
- The tumor is classified as pT2 (size between 3 cm and 5 cm).
- There is no regional lymph node involvement (pN0).
- There is no known distant metastasis (pMx).

According to the AJCC staging system:
- Stage I typically includes tumors that are small (T1) and have no lymph node involvement (N0).
- Stage II includes larger tumors (T2) but still without lymph node involvement (N0).
- Stage III involves lymph node involvement (N1 or higher).
- Stage IV indicates distant metastasis.

Given that the tumor is classified as pT2 and pN0, it fits the criteria for Stage II, as it is a larger tumor without lymph node involvement.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
12,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer based on the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key findings:

1. **Tumor Size**: The tumor is described as 2.7 cm in diameter. According to AJCC staging, a tumor size of less than 3 cm typically falls into Stage I.

2. **Tumor Invasion**: The report indicates that there is no angiolymphatic invasion and no pleural involvement. This suggests that the tumor has not spread beyond the lung tissue itself, which is consistent with early-stage cancer.

3. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report states that there is metastatic adenocarcinoma in 1 out of 4 peribronchial lymph nodes, but no metastatic carcinoma was found in the other lymph nodes examined (R4 and station 11). The presence of metastasis in 1 lymph node indicates a higher stage, but since only one lymph node is involved and the primary tumor is still relatively small, this does not elevate the stage beyond Stage II.

4. **Extracapsular Extension**: There is no extracapsular extension noted in the lymph nodes, which is another factor that would suggest a lower stage.

5. **Overall Assessment**: Given that the tumor is less than 3 cm, there is no pleural involvement, and only one lymph node is involved without extracapsular extension, the findings align with Stage I or Stage II. However, the presence of lymph node involvement typically indicates at least Stage II.

Based on these considerations, the most appropriate AJCC stage for this patient is Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
13,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the TNM staging information given:

1. **Tumor Size (T)**: The report indicates a tumor size of 1.2 cm, which is classified as pT2 according to AJCC staging. In the AJCC 8th edition, T2 is defined as a tumor greater than 3 cm but less than or equal to 5 cm, or a tumor that invades the visceral pleura.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N)**: The report states that there are 0 out of 7 lymph nodes involved (pN0). This means there is no regional lymph node involvement.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: The report indicates pMX, which means that the presence of distant metastasis is not assessed.

Now, we can summarize the findings:
- The tumor is classified as pT2.
- There is no lymph node involvement (pN0).
- Distant metastasis is not assessed (pMX).

According to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer:
- **Stage I**: T1 or T2, N0, M0
- **Stage II**: T2, N1, M0
- **Stage III**: T3 or T4, any N, M0
- **Stage IV**: Any T, any N, M1

Given that the tumor is pT2, pN0, and pMX, it fits the criteria for **Stage I** since there is no lymph node involvement and no distant metastasis assessed.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
14,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the information given regarding the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and metastasis.

1. **Tumor Size (T)**: The report indicates a tumor size of 4 cm in the right lower lobe, which is classified as pT2 according to AJCC staging. This means the tumor is greater than 3 cm but less than or equal to 5 cm.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N)**: The report states that there is metastatic adenocarcinoma in two of four lymph nodes (2/4) and one of five lymph nodes at level 7 (1/5). This indicates that there is regional lymph node involvement, which is classified as N2 (metastasis to ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes).

3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: The report indicates Mx, which means that the presence of distant metastasis is unknown. This does not confirm any distant spread of the cancer.

Based on the AJCC staging system:
- **Stage I**: T1, N0, M0 (small tumor, no lymph node involvement)
- **Stage II**: T2, N0, M0 (tumor size greater than 3 cm but no lymph node involvement)
- **Stage III**: T2, N1 or N2 (tumor size greater than 3 cm with lymph node involvement)
- **Stage IV**: Any T, any N, M1 (distant metastasis present)

Given that the patient has a pT2 classification, N2 involvement, and Mx (unknown distant metastasis), the appropriate classification is Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
15,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key findings related to the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and any distant metastasis.

1. **Tumor Size (T)**: The report indicates that the tumor is an invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with a greatest dimension of 9.2 cm. According to the AJCC staging system, this size classifies the tumor as T3 (tumor size > 7 cm).

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N)**: The report states that there is no evidence of carcinoma in the examined lymph nodes (0/19 lymph nodes negative for carcinoma). This indicates that there is no regional lymph node involvement, which classifies the nodal involvement as N0.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: The report does not mention any distant metastasis, which would classify the metastasis as M0.

Now, we can summarize the findings:
- T3 (tumor size > 7 cm)
- N0 (no regional lymph node involvement)
- M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC 7th Edition staging system for lung cancer:
- Stage I is classified as T1 or T2 with N0 and M0.
- Stage II is classified as T1 or T2 with N1 or T3 with N0 and M0.
- Stage III is classified as T3 with N1 or N2 or T4 with any N and M0.
- Stage IV is classified as any T with any N and M1.

Given that the patient has T3, N0, and M0, this fits the criteria for Stage II.

17,"## Answer
The provided pathology report does not contain specific information regarding tumor size, lymph node involvement, or distant metastasis, which are critical for determining the AJCC stage of cancer. The AJCC staging system relies on the TNM classification (Tumor size, Node involvement, Metastasis) to assign a stage. Without this information, it is impossible to accurately determine the stage of cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Unable to determine""}"
18,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key components of the report:

1. **Tumor Size and Extent**: The report indicates that the adenocarcinoma measures 50 mm and extends to the visceral pleura but is tumor-free at the bronchial resection level. According to AJCC staging, a tumor that is greater than 3 cm (which 50 mm is) and invades the visceral pleura is classified as T2.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report states ""pN 0"", which means there is no regional lymph node involvement. This is an important factor in staging, as the presence of lymph node involvement would elevate the stage.

3. **Distant Metastasis**: The report indicates ""pMX"", which means that the presence of distant metastasis cannot be assessed. However, since there is no mention of any distant spread, we can infer that it is likely not present.

4. **Stage Classification**: The report concludes with ""stage I B"". According to the AJCC staging system, Stage I is characterized by localized tumors without lymph node involvement or distant metastasis. Stage IB specifically refers to tumors that are larger than 3 cm but do not involve lymph nodes or metastasize.

Given these points, we can conclude that the cancer is classified as Stage I B based on the size of the tumor, lack of lymph node involvement, and absence of distant metastasis.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
19,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key findings in relation to the AJCC staging criteria for lung cancer.

1. **Tumor Size and Local Extent (T)**: The report indicates that the tumor is 4.5 cm in size and is located in the left upper lobe of the lung. It is described as having visceral pleural invasion, which is significant. According to AJCC staging, a tumor that is 3 cm or less is classified as T1, while a tumor that is larger than 3 cm but less than or equal to 5 cm is classified as T2a. Since the tumor is 4.5 cm and has pleural invasion, it is classified as T2a.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N)**: The report states that there is one lymph node containing metastatic carcinoma (N1). This indicates that there is regional lymph node involvement, which is classified as N1 in AJCC staging.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: The report indicates ""MX,"" which means that the presence of distant metastasis cannot be assessed. This is important because if there were evidence of distant metastasis, the stage would be classified as Stage IV.

4. **Combining the Findings**: Based on the findings:
   - T2a (tumor size >3 cm but ≤5 cm with pleural invasion)
   - N1 (metastasis to regional lymph nodes)
   - MX (distant metastasis cannot be assessed)

According to the AJCC staging system, the combination of T2a, N1, and MX corresponds to Stage IIIB. However, since the options provided do not include Stage IIIB, we need to consider the closest stage based on the information given.

Given that the tumor is not classified as Stage IV (due to the absence of confirmed distant metastasis), and it has regional lymph node involvement, the most appropriate classification based on the options provided would be Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
20,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer based on the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key components of the report in relation to the AJCC staging criteria for lung cancer.

1. **Tumor Size**: The report indicates a tumor size of 2.5 x 1.5 x 3 cm. According to AJCC staging, a tumor size of less than 3 cm typically falls into Stage I.

2. **Histologic Type**: The tumor is identified as bronchiolo-alveolar adenocarcinoma, which is a subtype of lung adenocarcinoma. This type of cancer can influence staging but does not change the basic size-related criteria.

3. **Histologic Grade**: The tumor is poorly differentiated. While this indicates a more aggressive tumor, it does not directly affect the AJCC stage.

4. **Tumor Extent**: The report states that tumor extent is not specified. This is important because if there were evidence of invasion into surrounding structures or other complications, it could indicate a higher stage.

5. **Lymph Nodes and Invasion**: The report does not specify any lymph node involvement, lymphatic invasion, or venous invasion. The absence of these factors typically suggests a lower stage.

6. **Margins and Additional Findings**: The report does not provide information on margins or additional findings, which could also influence staging.

Given that the tumor is less than 3 cm, there is no indication of lymph node involvement or distant metastasis, and the tumor is localized to the lung, it aligns with the criteria for Stage I lung cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
21,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key findings:

1. **Primary Tumor (pT)**: The report indicates a primary tumor classified as pT1b, which means it is a tumor that is 2.5 cm in greatest dimension. According to AJCC staging, this falls under Stage I, as Stage I tumors are typically ≤ 3 cm without any regional lymph node involvement.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes**: The report states that five lymph nodes were examined (0/5 positive for malignancy). This indicates that there is no regional lymph node involvement, which is consistent with Stage I criteria.

3. **Margins of Resection**: The report mentions negative margins, meaning that the tumor has been completely excised without any cancer cells at the edges of the removed tissue. This is also a favorable finding for Stage I.

4. **Direct Extension and Invasion**: The report notes that there is no direct extension of the tumor into surrounding tissues and no evidence of vascular invasion. This further supports a lower stage classification.

5. **Overall Assessment**: Given that the tumor is ≤ 3 cm, there is no lymph node involvement, and the margins are negative, the findings align with the criteria for Stage I cancer.

Based on this analysis, the appropriate AJCC stage for this patient's cancer is Stage I.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N)**: The report mentions metastatic carcinoma in multiple lymph nodes (Level 7, Level 12, and R4). Specifically, it states ""metastatic adenocarcinoma to 2 cm peribronchial lymph node,"" which indicates involvement of regional lymph nodes. This is classified as N2 (metastasis to ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes).

3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: The report does not indicate any distant metastasis (M0), as it states ""MX"" which means the presence of distant metastasis is not assessed.

Based on the AJCC staging system:
- **Stage I**: T1, N0, M0
- **Stage II**: T1, N1, M0 or T2, N0, M0
- **Stage III**: T1, N2, M0 or T2, N1, M0
- **Stage IV**: Any T, any N, M1

Given that the tumor is T1, N2, and M0, this corresponds to **Stage III**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
23,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer based on the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key findings:

1. **Tumor Size and Characteristics**: The report indicates that the tumor is an adenocarcinoma measuring 2.0 cm in maximal dimension. It is classified as pT1a, which means it is 2 cm or less in greatest dimension and does not invade the visceral pleura.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report states that multiple lymph nodes were examined, and all were negative for malignancy (0/1 lymph node involved). This indicates that there is no regional lymph node metastasis, classified as pN0.

3. **Margins**: The surgical resection margins (bronchial, vascular, parenchymal, and pleural) are all reported as uninvolved by invasive carcinoma, which is a positive finding indicating that the tumor has been completely resected without any residual disease at the margins.

4. **AJCC Staging**: According to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer:
   - Stage I is characterized by a primary tumor (T) that is 3 cm or less (T1) and no regional lymph node involvement (N0).
   - Since the tumor is 2.0 cm (T1a) and there is no lymph node involvement (N0), this fits the criteria for Stage I.

Given these points, the cancer is classified as Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
24,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key components of the report, specifically the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and metastasis status.

1. **Tumor Size (pT)**: The report indicates a tumor size of 6.5 x 6.5 x 5.0 cm, classified as pT2b. According to AJCC staging for lung cancer, pT2b indicates a tumor size greater than 5 cm but less than or equal to 7 cm.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (pN)**: The report states pN1 (6/28), which means that there is involvement of regional lymph nodes. Specifically, pN1 indicates that there are metastases in 1 to 3 regional lymph nodes.

3. **Metastasis (pM)**: The report indicates pMx, which means that the presence of distant metastasis cannot be assessed. This does not confirm any distant spread of cancer.

Now, we can summarize the findings:
- The tumor is classified as pT2b (size >5 cm but ≤7 cm).
- There is regional lymph node involvement classified as pN1.
- There is no evidence of distant metastasis (pMx).

According to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer:
- Stage I: Tumor confined to the lung without lymph node involvement.
- Stage II: Tumor size ≤ 7 cm with regional lymph node involvement (pN1).
- Stage III: More extensive lymph node involvement or larger tumor size.
- Stage IV: Distant metastasis present.

Given that the tumor is pT2b and pN1, this fits the criteria for Stage II, as it indicates a tumor size greater than 5 cm with regional lymph node involvement but no distant metastasis.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
25,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the findings in relation to the AJCC staging criteria for lung cancer.

1. **Tumor Size and Local Extent (T)**: 
   - The largest tumor in the left upper lobe measures 5.0 cm, which classifies it as T2 (tumor size > 3 cm but ≤ 7 cm).
   - There is also a smaller tumor in the left lower lobe measuring 1.0 cm, classified as T1 (tumor size ≤ 3 cm).

2. **Regional Lymph Node Involvement (N)**: 
   - The report indicates that there are multiple lymph nodes involved with metastatic adenocarcinoma. Specifically, it states that 8 out of 12 lymph nodes are positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma, and there is direct extension into two intraparenchymal lymph nodes. This indicates significant lymph node involvement, classified as N2 (metastasis to ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes).

3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: 
   - The report indicates MX, which means that the presence of distant metastasis cannot be assessed. This is important because if there were confirmed distant metastasis, it would classify the cancer as Stage IV.

4. **Combining the Findings**: 
   - Based on the findings, we have T2 (for the larger tumor), N2 (for the lymph node involvement), and MX (unknown distant metastasis). According to AJCC staging:
     - Stage III is characterized by T2 or T3 with N2 involvement and no distant metastasis.
     - Stage IV would require confirmed distant metastasis.

Given that there is no evidence of distant metastasis (as indicated by MX), the cancer is classified as Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
26,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the TNM classification provided in the report. The TNM classification is as follows:

- **pT2a**: This indicates that the primary tumor is invasive and measures more than 3 cm but not more than 5 cm in greatest dimension. In this case, the tumor size is 3.5 cm, which fits this classification.
  
- **pN1**: This indicates that there is regional lymph node involvement. Specifically, it means that there are metastases in 1 to 3 regional lymph nodes. The report states that 2 of 2 peribronchial nodes are positive for metastatic tumor, which confirms this classification.

- **pMX**: This indicates that the distant metastasis cannot be assessed. In this case, there is no information provided about distant metastasis, so we cannot confirm its presence or absence.

Now, we can summarize the findings:
- The tumor is classified as pT2a (size 3.5 cm).
- There is regional lymph node involvement classified as pN1 (2 positive nodes).
- Distant metastasis is not assessed (pMX).

According to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer:
- Stage I is characterized by a small tumor without lymph node involvement.
- Stage II involves a larger tumor or local lymph node involvement.
- Stage III indicates more extensive lymph node involvement or local invasion.
- Stage IV indicates distant metastasis.

Given that the patient has a pT2a tumor and pN1 involvement, this aligns with Stage II of lung cancer, as there is regional lymph node involvement but no distant metastasis indicated.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
27,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the pathology report, we need to analyze the key findings:

1. **Tumor Size and Location**: The tumor is located in the left upper lobe and measures 3.5 x 2.8 x 2.5 cm. This size indicates that it is larger than 3 cm, which is relevant for staging.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report indicates that there is metastatic adenocarcinoma in the peribronchial lymph nodes (N2). This suggests that the cancer has spread to regional lymph nodes.

3. **Vascular and Lymphatic Invasion**: The report states that vascular invasion was not identified, but there are tumor cells present within lymphatic spaces in the bronchial margin. This indicates some level of lymphatic involvement.

4. **Pleural Invasion**: The tumor invades into the visceral pleura, which is significant for staging.

5. **Pathologic Stage**: The report explicitly states the pathologic stage as p stage IIIA (pT2a N2 MX). This classification indicates:
   - pT2a: The tumor is larger than 3 cm but not larger than 5 cm.
   - N2: Metastasis to regional lymph nodes.
   - MX: Distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Given these findings, the cancer is classified as Stage IIIA according to the AJCC staging system.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
28,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key findings in relation to the AJCC staging criteria.

1. **Tumor Size and Local Extent (T)**: The report indicates a cavitated poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma measuring 58 mm in maximum dimension. It has invaded through the visceral pleura and into the chest wall fibrous connective tissue. This indicates a T3 classification, as T3 is defined as a tumor that invades the chest wall or pleura.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N)**: The report states that there are no lymph node metastases identified (N0). This means that the cancer has not spread to nearby lymph nodes.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: The report does not indicate any distant metastasis (MX), which means that the presence of distant metastasis is not assessed, but it is implied that there are no distant metastases.

Based on the findings:
- The tumor is classified as T3 (invasion into the chest wall).
- There are no lymph node metastases (N0).
- There is no evidence of distant metastasis (MX).

According to the AJCC staging system:
- Stage I is characterized by localized tumors without lymph node involvement.
- Stage II typically involves larger tumors or local spread to nearby structures but may still have N0.
- Stage III involves more extensive local disease or lymph node involvement.
- Stage IV indicates distant metastasis.

Given that the tumor is T3, N0, and MX, it fits the criteria for Stage II, as it indicates a locally advanced tumor without lymph node involvement.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
29,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key components of the report, specifically the T (tumor), N (nodes), and M (metastasis) classifications.

1. **Tumor Size and Local Extent (T)**: The report indicates ""T2"", which typically means the tumor is larger than 3 cm but not larger than 5 cm. This suggests a moderate local extent of the tumor.

2. **Regional Lymph Node Involvement (N)**: The report states ""N1"", which indicates that there is involvement of regional lymph nodes. This suggests that the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes, which is a significant factor in staging.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: The report shows ""M0"", indicating that there is no distant metastasis. This is a crucial point as it suggests that the cancer has not spread to distant organs.

Now, we can summarize the findings:
- T2 (tumor size between 3-5 cm)
- N1 (regional lymph node involvement)
- M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer:
- Stage I is characterized by T1 or T2 with no lymph node involvement (N0).
- Stage II typically involves T2 with N1 or T3 with N0.
- Stage III involves more extensive lymph node involvement (N2 or N3) or larger tumors (T3 or T4).
- Stage IV indicates distant metastasis (M1).

Given that the patient has T2, N1, and M0, this aligns with the criteria for Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
30,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key components of the report in relation to the AJCC staging criteria for lung adenocarcinoma.

1. **Tumor Size**: The report indicates that the tumor measures 3.5 cm in its largest dimension. According to AJCC staging, a tumor size of 3 cm or less is classified as T1, while a tumor size greater than 3 cm but less than or equal to 5 cm is classified as T2.

2. **Tumor Extent**: The report mentions ""Tumor Extent: growth"" but does not specify any local invasion into surrounding structures, which is important for determining the T classification. Since there is no mention of invasion into the chest wall or other structures, we will consider it as T2.

3. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report states that 0 out of 7 hilar lymph nodes examined showed metastasis. This indicates that there is no regional lymph node involvement, which is classified as N0.

4. **Distant Metastasis**: There is no mention of any distant metastasis in the report, which would classify the M category as M0.

5. **Putting it all together**: Based on the above findings:
   - Tumor size: 3.5 cm (T2)
   - Lymph node involvement: N0
   - Distant metastasis: M0

According to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer:
- T2 N0 M0 corresponds to Stage IIB.

However, since the options provided do not include Stage IIB, we need to consider the closest stage. Stage I is typically for T1 tumors, and Stage II is for T2 tumors with some lymph node involvement. Since there is no lymph node involvement (N0), the most appropriate classification would be Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
31,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key findings in the report and correlate them with the AJCC staging criteria.

1. **Tumor Size and Extent**: The report indicates that the largest tumor mass measures 3.7 cm, and there are separate tumor nodules in the same lobe. According to AJCC staging, a tumor size greater than 3 cm but less than or equal to 5 cm is classified as T2. However, since there are multiple nodules, we need to consider the overall extent of the disease.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report states that 11 lymph nodes were examined, and all were negative for malignancy (0/3 involved). This indicates that there is no regional lymph node involvement, which is classified as N0.

3. **Distant Metastasis**: The report indicates that there is no mention of distant metastasis (pM is not applicable), which suggests that there are no distant spread of cancer cells.

4. **Pathologic Staging**: The report explicitly states a pathologic staging of Stage IIB (pT3, pNO). This means that the tumor is classified as T3 (tumor size > 3 cm but ≤ 5 cm, with no lymph node involvement) and N0 (no regional lymph node involvement).

Based on the above analysis, the cancer is classified as Stage IIB according to the AJCC staging system.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
32,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key findings related to the primary tumor, regional lymph nodes, and distant metastasis.

1. **Primary Tumor (PT)**: The report indicates that the tumor is classified as T2, which means it is greater than 3 cm in greatest dimension. The tumor size is specifically noted as 3.5 cm.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (PN)**: The report states that there are metastases in the ipsilateral peribronchial and ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes. This indicates that there is involvement of regional lymph nodes, which is significant for staging.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: The report indicates MX, which means that distant metastasis cannot be assessed. This does not confirm the presence of distant metastasis, but it also does not rule it out.

4. **Invasion**: The report mentions that there is visceral pleura invasion and that there is venous, arterial, and lymphatic invasion present. This suggests a more advanced disease.

Based on the AJCC staging system:
- **Stage I**: Tumor confined to the lung without lymph node involvement.
- **Stage II**: Tumor with local lymph node involvement but no distant metastasis.
- **Stage III**: Tumor with extensive local lymph node involvement and/or invasion of surrounding structures.
- **Stage IV**: Distant metastasis present.

Given that the tumor is T2, there is regional lymph node involvement (N1), and there is no clear evidence of distant metastasis (MX), the most appropriate stage for this cancer is **Stage III**. The presence of visceral pleura invasion and lymphatic invasion further supports this classification.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
33,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer based on the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key findings regarding the primary tumor, lymph node involvement, and any distant metastasis.

1. **Primary Tumor (pT)**: The report indicates that the primary tumor is an adenocarcinoma measuring 2.5 cm in greatest dimension. The visceral pleura was disrupted, suggesting possible invasion. According to AJCC staging:
   - T1: Tumor ≤ 3 cm without invasion of visceral pleura.
   - T2: Tumor > 3 cm or with visceral pleura invasion.
   Since the tumor is 2.5 cm but has visceral pleura invasion, it is classified as T2.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN)**: The report states that there are four lymph nodes from level 12 with evidence of metastasis. The other lymph nodes (level 7, 9, and 11) show no evidence of metastasis. According to AJCC:
   - N0: No regional lymph node involvement.
   - N1: Metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial and/or hilar lymph nodes.
   - N2: Metastasis to ipsilateral mediastinal lymph nodes.
   - N3: Metastasis to contralateral lymph nodes or supraclavicular lymph nodes.
   Since there is metastasis to level 12 lymph nodes, this indicates N1 involvement.

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM)**: The report states that distant metastasis cannot be evaluated (pMX), which means we cannot confirm any distant spread.

Now, we can summarize the findings:
- Primary Tumor: T2 (due to visceral pleura invasion)
- Regional Lymph Nodes: N1 (metastasis to level 12 lymph nodes)
- Distant Metastasis: M0 (not evaluated, but no evidence of distant spread)

According to the AJCC staging system:
- Stage I: T1 N0 M0
- Stage II: T2 N0 M0 or T1 N1 M0
- Stage III: T2 N1 M0 or T3 N0 M0
- Stage IV: Any T, any N, M1

Given that we have T2 N1 M0, this corresponds to Stage II.

34,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key findings in the report according to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer.

1. **Tumor Size and Local Extent (pT)**: The report indicates that the tumor measures 3.5 cm and is classified as pT2, which means it is a tumor that is larger than 3 cm but less than or equal to 5 cm and is invading the pleura.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (pN)**: The report states that regional lymph nodes are classified as pNX, which means that the regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed. This indicates that there is no evidence of lymph node involvement.

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM)**: The report indicates pMX, meaning that distant metastasis cannot be assessed. This does not confirm the presence of metastasis, but it does not rule it out either.

4. **Margins of Resection**: The report mentions that the margins of resection are negative, which is a favorable finding as it suggests that the tumor has been completely removed without any cancer cells at the edges of the resected tissue.

Based on the AJCC staging criteria:
- **Stage I**: Tumor ≤ 3 cm, no lymph node involvement, no metastasis.
- **Stage II**: Tumor > 3 cm but ≤ 5 cm, no lymph node involvement, no metastasis.
- **Stage III**: Involvement of regional lymph nodes or larger tumors with local invasion.
- **Stage IV**: Distant metastasis present.

Given that the tumor is classified as pT2 (3.5 cm), there is no lymph node involvement (pNX), and no distant metastasis is confirmed (pMX), the appropriate stage for this cancer is Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
35,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key components of the pathologic stage indicated as T2N0MX.

1. **T (Tumor Size and Local Extent)**: The report states that the tumor is 2.8 cm in diameter and is classified as T2. According to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer, T2 indicates a tumor size greater than 3 cm but less than or equal to 5 cm, or a tumor that has invaded the visceral pleura or has associated atelectasis or obstructive pneumonia.

2. **N (Regional Lymph Nodes Involvement)**: The report indicates N0, which means there is no regional lymph node involvement. This is a crucial factor as it suggests that the cancer has not spread to nearby lymph nodes.

3. **M (Distant Metastasis)**: The report states MX, which means that the presence of distant metastasis cannot be assessed. However, since there is no indication of metastasis in the report, we can infer that the cancer is likely localized.

Now, we can summarize the findings:
- The tumor is classified as T2 (2.8 cm, with pleural invasion).
- There is no lymph node involvement (N0).
- The status of distant metastasis is unknown (MX).

According to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer:
- Stage I is characterized by T1 or T2 with N0 and M0.
- Stage II typically involves larger tumors or those with local spread to lymph nodes (N1).
- Stage III involves more extensive lymph node involvement or local invasion.
- Stage IV indicates distant metastasis.

Given that the tumor is T2, N0, and MX, it fits the criteria for Stage I, as it does not meet the criteria for Stage II or higher due to the absence of lymph node involvement and the lack of evidence for distant metastasis.

Therefore, the answer is -

36,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key findings in the report and correlate them with the AJCC staging criteria for lung cancer.

1. **Tumor Size and Location**: The report indicates a maximum tumor size of 5.5 x 5.0 cm located in the middle lobe of the right lung. According to AJCC staging, a tumor size greater than 5 cm typically falls into Stage II or higher.

2. **Tumor Focality**: The tumor is described as unifocal, which is a positive aspect for staging as multifocal tumors may indicate a higher stage.

3. **Histologic Type and Grade**: The tumor is identified as a poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinoma (G3). Poor differentiation can correlate with a more aggressive disease, but it does not directly affect the stage.

4. **Visceral Pleural Invasion**: The report states that there is no visceral pleural invasion, which is a favorable finding. If there were pleural invasion, it could indicate a higher stage.

5. **Tumor Extension**: The tumor extends into the fissure, which is significant. Tumors that invade surrounding structures can indicate a higher stage.

6. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report mentions that twelve lymph nodes were examined, and they were negative for carcinoma. This is crucial because the presence of lymph node involvement typically raises the stage.

7. **Overall Assessment**: Given the tumor size (5.5 cm), unifocality, absence of visceral pleural invasion, and negative lymph nodes, the findings suggest that the cancer is likely at least Stage II, but not advanced enough to be Stage III or IV.

Based on the AJCC staging criteria:
- **Stage I**: Tumor ≤ 3 cm, no lymph node involvement.
- **Stage II**: Tumor > 3 cm but ≤ 5 cm, or any size with local lymph node involvement.
- **Stage III**: Tumor of any size with extensive local invasion or lymph node involvement.
- **Stage IV**: Distant metastasis.

Since the tumor is greater than 5 cm, but there is no lymph node involvement, the most appropriate stage is Stage II.

37,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer based on the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the findings in relation to the AJCC staging criteria.

1. **Tumor Size and Local Extent (T)**: The report indicates a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma in the right lung measuring 7 cm. There is no invasion of the visceral pleura, which is significant for staging. According to AJCC, a tumor size of 7 cm without pleural invasion suggests a T2 classification (T2a is for tumors > 5 cm but ≤ 7 cm).

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N)**: The report states that there are no tumors found in the examined lymph nodes (0/4 in level 9, 0/5 in level 4, and 0/13 in level 7). This indicates that there is no regional lymph node involvement, which corresponds to an N0 classification.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: The report does not mention any distant metastasis, which would classify the cancer as M0.

Now, we can summarize the findings:
- T2 (tumor size > 5 cm but ≤ 7 cm, no pleural invasion)
- N0 (no regional lymph node involvement)
- M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC staging system:
- Stage I is defined as T1 or T2, N0, M0.
- Stage II typically involves either a larger tumor or regional lymph node involvement (N1).
- Stage III involves more extensive local or regional spread (N2 or N3).
- Stage IV indicates distant metastasis (M1).

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N)**: The report states that there is metastatic carcinoma in 3 of 18 lymph nodes, which classifies it as pN1 (metastasis in ipsilateral peribronchial lymph nodes). This indicates that there is regional lymph node involvement.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: The report does not mention any distant metastasis, which would classify it as M0.

Now, we can summarize the findings:
- T: pT2a
- N: pN1

According to the AJCC 7th Edition staging system for lung cancer:
- Stage I is characterized by T1 or T2 with no lymph node involvement (N0).
- Stage II is characterized by T1 or T2 with N1 involvement.
- Stage III is characterized by more extensive lymph node involvement (N2 or N3).
- Stage IV is characterized by any T with M1 (distant metastasis).

Given that the patient has a T2a classification, N1 involvement, and no distant metastasis (M0), the appropriate AJCC stage is Stage II.
