The pathology report provides detailed information about the lung cancer diagnosis. Let's break down the key elements relevant to staging:

1. **Primary Tumor (pT):** The report indicates a pT2a classification. This means the tumor is greater than 3 cm but 5 cm or less in greatest dimension, surrounded by lung or visceral pleura without bronchoscopic evidence of invasion more proximal than the lobar bronchus.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN):** The report states pN0, indicating no regional lymph node metastasis. All lymph nodes examined (levels 5, 7, and 9) were negative for carcinoma.

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM):** The report mentions ""Not applicable"" for distant metastasis, implying there is no evidence of distant metastasis.

4. **Multiple Primary Tumors:** The report notes ""m (multiple primary tumors)"" indicating the presence of synchronous carcinomas in the lingula and left lower lobe, which are considered separate primaries.

Based on the AJCC staging system for lung cancer:
- **Stage I** typically involves a tumor that is 3 cm or less (T1) and no lymph node involvement (N0) or distant metastasis (M0).
- **Stage II** can involve a larger tumor (T2) with no lymph node involvement (N0) or a smaller tumor with minimal lymph node involvement (N1).
- **Stage III** involves more extensive lymph node involvement (N2 or N3) or a larger tumor with certain features.
- **Stage IV** involves distant metastasis (M1).

Given the information:
- The tumor is classified as pT2a.
- There is no lymph node involvement (pN0).
- There is no distant metastasis (pM0).

Therefore, the cancer is best classified as **Stage II** due to the tumor size and lack of lymph node involvement or distant metastasis.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
1,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging:

1. **Tumor Size and Characteristics**: The tumor is an adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated, located in the subpleural right lower lung lobe, with a size of 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.6 cm. It is classified as T2 due to its size and pleural invasion.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: All lymph nodes examined (R lymph node, L lymph node, Station 11, Station 12, and Station 7) are negative for neoplasm, indicating no regional lymph node metastasis. This corresponds to N0.

3. **Distant Metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, which would be classified as M0.

Given the TNM classification of T2N0M0, the cancer is staged according to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system. For lung cancer, T2N0M0 corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
2,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging:

1. **Primary Tumor (pT):** The tumor is classified as pT1b, which indicates a tumor size greater than 2 cm but 3 cm or less in greatest dimension.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN):** The report indicates pN1, meaning there is metastasis in ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes and intrapulmonary nodes, including involvement by direct extension.

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM):** The report states pMX, which means distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

According to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for lung cancer:

- **Stage I** typically involves pT1 or pT2 with pN0 (no regional lymph node involvement).
- **Stage II** involves pT1 or pT2 with pN1 (regional lymph node involvement).
- **Stage III** involves pT1 or pT2 with pN2 or pN3, or pT3 with any N.
- **Stage IV** involves any T, any N, and pM1 (distant metastasis present).

Given the information:
- The tumor is pT1b.
- There is regional lymph node involvement (pN1).
- Distant metastasis cannot be assessed (pMX).

This aligns with **Stage II** lung cancer, as the presence of pN1 with pT1b fits the criteria for Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
3,"## Answer
The pathology report provides several key pieces of information that are crucial for determining the AJCC stage of the cancer:

1. **Tumor Size and Extent of Invasion (T category):** The maximum tumor size is reported as 2.5 x 2.0 cm, and the extent of invasion is classified as pT1. This indicates a relatively small tumor that is limited to the lung.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N category):** The report states pN2, with ten of twelve lymph nodes involved by metastatic carcinoma, including the subcarinal lymph node. N2 indicates metastasis to ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M category):** The report lists pMX, meaning that distant metastasis cannot be assessed. However, there is no indication of distant metastasis in the report.

Based on the AJCC staging system for lung cancer:
- **Stage I** typically involves a small tumor (T1) with no lymph node involvement (N0) and no distant metastasis (M0).
- **Stage II** involves a larger tumor or limited lymph node involvement (N1) but no distant metastasis (M0).
- **Stage III** involves more extensive lymph node involvement (N2 or N3) and/or a larger tumor, but no distant metastasis (M0).
- **Stage IV** involves distant metastasis (M1).

Given the information:
- The tumor is classified as pT1.
- There is significant lymph node involvement classified as pN2.
- There is no evidence of distant metastasis (pMX, but no indication of M1).

Therefore, the cancer is best classified as Stage III, as it involves N2 lymph node involvement without evidence of distant metastasis.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
4,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging the cancer according to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) guidelines:

1. **Primary Tumor (T):** The tumor is described as an invasive poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma measuring 2.7 cm in greatest dimension and invades the visceral pleura. This corresponds to a classification of pT2a.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):** The report indicates that two lymph nodes were examined and both were negative for metastatic carcinoma, which corresponds to pN0.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** There is no mention of distant metastasis, which implies M0.

Based on the AJCC 7th edition TNM staging system for lung cancer:
- **Stage I:** T1-2a, N0, M0
- **Stage II:** T2b-3, N0, M0 or T1-2, N1, M0
- **Stage III:** T1-3, N2, M0 or T3, N1, M0 or T4, any N, M0
- **Stage IV:** Any T, any N, M1

Given the tumor is pT2a, N0, M0, this corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
5,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging the cancer according to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) guidelines:

1. **Primary Tumor (pT):** The tumor is classified as pT1b, which indicates a tumor greater than 2 cm but 3 cm or less in greatest dimension, surrounded by lung or visceral pleura, without bronchoscopic evidence of invasion more proximal than the lobar bronchus (i.e., not in the main bronchus).

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN):** The report indicates pN0, meaning there is no regional lymph node metastasis. All lymph nodes examined (levels 4, 7, and 10) were negative for carcinoma.

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM):** The report states ""Not applicable"" for distant metastasis, which typically implies that there is no evidence of distant metastasis (pM0).

Based on the TNM classification:
- T1b indicates a small tumor size.
- N0 indicates no lymph node involvement.
- M0 (implied) indicates no distant metastasis.

According to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer, a T1b N0 M0 classification corresponds to Stage I cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
6,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the lung cancer from the pathology report, we need to consider the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and any distant metastasis.

1. **Tumor Size (T):** The report describes an invasive adenocarcinoma forming a 5 x 4 x 3 cm mass in the right lower lobe. According to AJCC staging, a tumor greater than 4 cm but not more than 5 cm is classified as T2b.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N):** The report indicates that one of six intrapulmonary peribronchial lymph nodes is positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma. This suggests N1 involvement, which is defined as metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes and intrapulmonary nodes, including involvement by direct extension.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so we assume M0.

Based on the above information:
- T2b (tumor size > 4 cm but â‰¤ 5 cm)
- N1 (metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes)
- M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system for lung cancer, a T2b, N1, M0 classification corresponds to Stage IIB.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
7,"## Answer
The pathology report provides detailed information about the tumor and its characteristics. Let's break down the key points:

1. **Tumor Size and Characteristics**: The tumor is described as a 2.3 cm adenocarcinoma located in the right lung lower lobe. It is moderately differentiated and unifocal.

2. **Visceral Pleural Invasion**: The carcinoma extends up to but not through the visceral pleura, indicating no pleural invasion beyond the visceral pleura.

3. **Lymphovascular Invasion**: There are foci highly suspicious for lymphovascular space invasion, but this is not definitively confirmed.

4. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report states that no metastatic carcinoma is identified in the lymph nodes examined (0/2 in level 7, 0/3 in peribronchial, 0/1 in level 9, and fragmented nodes in level 4 with no metastasis).

5. **Surgical Margins**: The carcinoma extends to within 1 mm of the staple line, but no residual carcinoma is identified in the lobectomy specimen.

6. **Staging Information**: The report explicitly states the pTN stage as pT1b N0, which indicates a tumor size greater than 2 cm but 3 cm or less (T1b) with no regional lymph node metastasis (N0).

Based on the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for lung cancer, a pT1b N0 classification corresponds to Stage I. Specifically, it is Stage IA2, but since the options provided are general stages, it falls under Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
8,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging:

1. **Primary Tumor (T):** The tumor is an invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma located in the right upper lobe of the lung. The tumor size is 3.5 cm, and it does not invade the pleura or bronchus, but it is close to the bronchial margin (0.3 cm). There is no angiolymphatic invasion, but perineural invasion is present. The presence of satellite tumor nodules is noted, but they are not described as distant metastases.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):** Metastatic adenocarcinoma is found in 1 out of 5 hilar lymph nodes. The other lymph nodes (R4, right mainstem bronchus, R9, station 7) are negative for carcinoma. This indicates regional lymph node involvement.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report.

Based on the AJCC staging system for lung cancer:
- The primary tumor size and characteristics suggest a T2 classification (tumor >3 cm but â‰¤5 cm, or tumor with certain features such as proximity to the bronchus).
- The involvement of one hilar lymph node suggests N1 classification (metastasis in ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes and intrapulmonary nodes, including involvement by direct extension).
- There is no evidence of distant metastasis, so M0.

Combining these, the cancer would be classified as T2N1M0, which corresponds to Stage II in the AJCC staging system for lung cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
9,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to consider the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and metastasis status as described in the pathology report.

1. **Tumor Size and Extent (T):** 
   - The tumor measures approximately 50 x 60 x 45 mm, which corresponds to a T2 classification (tumor size >3 cm but â‰¤5 cm or involves the main bronchus without involvement of the carina, invades visceral pleura, or associated with atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis extending to the hilar region).
   - The report mentions ""T2N0Mx,"" indicating a T2 classification.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N):**
   - The report states ""No metastases to hilar lymph nodes are seen,"" which corresponds to N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis).

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):**
   - The report uses ""Mx,"" indicating that distant metastasis cannot be assessed. However, there is no mention of confirmed distant metastasis in the report.

4. **Additional Findings:**
   - The tumor does not invade the pleura as confirmed by special stains.
   - The bronchial resection margin is free of tumor.
   - No vascular or perineural invasion is seen.

Based on the information provided:
- T2 (tumor size and extent)
- N0 (no lymph node involvement)
- Mx (distant metastasis cannot be assessed, but no evidence of metastasis is provided)

According to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer, a T2N0M0 classification corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
10,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the lung cancer from the pathology report, we need to consider the following key factors:

1. **Tumor Size and Extent (T):** The tumor is 3 x 3 x 3 cm and involves the visceral pleura. According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor that is 3 cm in greatest dimension and involves the visceral pleura is classified as T2.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N):** There is 1 out of 1 lymph node positive for metastasis (intrathoracic). This indicates N1 involvement, as the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes within the thoracic region.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so we assume M0.

Based on these factors:
- T2 (tumor size and pleural involvement)
- N1 (regional lymph node involvement)
- M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system for lung cancer, a T2 N1 M0 classification corresponds to Stage IIB.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
11,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to consider the TNM classification provided in the pathology report:

1. **Tumor Size and Extent (T):** The report states ""pT2"". According to the AJCC staging system, T2 indicates a tumor size greater than 3 cm but less than or equal to 5 cm, or a tumor that involves the main bronchus or invades the visceral pleura, or is associated with atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis that extends to the hilar region but does not involve the entire lung.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):** The report states ""pN0 (0/20)"", which means there is no regional lymph node metastasis. N0 indicates that the cancer has not spread to nearby lymph nodes.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** The report states ""pMx"", which means the presence of distant metastasis cannot be assessed. However, for staging purposes, we typically assume M0 (no distant metastasis) unless otherwise specified.

Given these factors:
- T2
- N0
- M0 (assumed)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system for lung cancer:
- T2, N0, M0 corresponds to Stage IIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
12,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to consider the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and any distant metastasis.

1. **Tumor Size (T):** The tumor is 2.7 cm in diameter. According to the AJCC 8th edition for lung cancer, a tumor size of 2.7 cm falls under T1c (tumors >2 cm but â‰¤3 cm).

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N):** The pathology report indicates that there is metastatic adenocarcinoma in 1 out of 4 peribronchial lymph nodes. The other lymph nodes (R4 and station 11) show no metastatic carcinoma. Involvement of peribronchial lymph nodes corresponds to N1 (metastasis in ipsilateral peribronchial and/or hilar lymph nodes).

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so we assume M0 (no distant metastasis).

Based on the above information:
- T1c (tumor size >2 cm but â‰¤3 cm)
- N1 (metastasis in ipsilateral peribronchial lymph nodes)
- M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging for lung cancer, a T1c N1 M0 classification corresponds to Stage IIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
13,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging:

1. **Tumor Size and Invasion**: The tumor is 1.2 cm in size and invades into, but not through, the visceral pleura. This corresponds to a T2 classification because it involves the visceral pleura.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: A total of 7 lymph nodes were examined, and none were involved with cancer (0/7). This corresponds to an N0 classification.

3. **Distant Metastasis**: The report indicates pMX, meaning that distant metastasis cannot be assessed from the information provided.

Based on the TNM classification provided (pT2, pN0, pMX), we can determine the stage:

- **Stage I**: Typically involves T1 or T2 tumors with N0 and M0.
- **Stage II**: Involves T1 or T2 tumors with N1 or T3 with N0.
- **Stage III**: Involves T1-T3 with N2 or T4 with any N.
- **Stage IV**: Involves any T, any N, and M1.

Given that the tumor is T2, N0, and there is no information on metastasis (MX), the most appropriate stage based on the available information is Stage I, as there is no lymph node involvement and no confirmed distant metastasis.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
14,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following information:

1. **Primary Tumor (T):** The tumor is described as adenocarcinoma, acinar type, grade III, measuring 4 cm, and invading the visceral pleura. This corresponds to a T2 classification, as it is more than 3 cm but less than 5 cm and involves the visceral pleura.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):** Metastatic adenocarcinoma is found in two of four lymph nodes, including level 7 lymph nodes. This indicates N2 classification, as it involves metastasis to ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** The report states Mx, meaning distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

According to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for lung cancer:

- **Stage III** is characterized by T1-T2, N2, M0 or T3, N1-N2, M0. Given the T2, N2, Mx classification, this aligns with Stage III, assuming no distant metastasis (M0).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
15,"## Answer
The pathology report provides detailed information about the tumor and lymph node involvement:

1. **Tumor Size and Invasion**: The tumor is an invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma measuring 9.2 cm in greatest dimension, invading into the chest wall. This indicates a T3 classification due to the size and chest wall invasion.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report states that there is no lymph node involvement (N0), as all examined lymph nodes (including peribronchial and mediastinal nodes) are negative for carcinoma.

3. **Metastasis**: The report does not provide information on distant metastasis (Mx), meaning it is not assessed.

Based on the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 7th Edition, the pathological staging is pT3 N0 Mx. In the context of lung cancer staging:

- **Stage I**: Typically involves smaller tumors (T1 or T2) with no lymph node involvement (N0) and no metastasis (M0).
- **Stage II**: Involves larger tumors (T2 or T3) with no lymph node involvement (N0) or smaller tumors with limited lymph node involvement (N1).
- **Stage III**: Involves larger tumors (T3 or T4) with more extensive lymph node involvement (N1 or N2).
- **Stage IV**: Involves any tumor size with distant metastasis (M1).

Given the tumor is T3 due to its size and chest wall invasion, and there is no lymph node involvement (N0) or assessed metastasis (Mx), this aligns with **Stage II** lung cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
16,"## Answer
The pathology report provides several key pieces of information that are crucial for determining the AJCC stage of the cancer:

1. **Primary Tumor (pT):** The tumor is classified as pT2b, which indicates a tumor greater than 5 cm but 7 cm or less in greatest dimension.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN):** The report indicates pN2, which means there is metastasis in ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes. Specifically, 7 out of 19 lymph nodes are involved.

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM):** The report states ""Not applicable"" for distant metastasis, suggesting there is no evidence of distant metastasis.

According to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer:
- **Stage I** typically involves a smaller tumor size and no lymph node involvement.
- **Stage II** may involve a larger tumor or limited lymph node involvement.
- **Stage III** involves larger tumors and/or significant lymph node involvement, particularly in the mediastinal region (pN2).
- **Stage IV** involves distant metastasis.

Given the information:
- The tumor size and lymph node involvement (pT2b and pN2) align with **Stage III** lung cancer, as there is significant lymph node involvement but no distant metastasis.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
17,"## Answer
The provided text does not contain specific information about the tumor size, lymph node involvement, or metastasis, which are critical components for determining the AJCC stage of cancer. The text appears to be instructions for completing a pathology report form rather than an actual pathology report with diagnostic details. Without specific details such as T (tumor size), N (lymph node involvement), and M (metastasis) classifications, it is impossible to accurately determine the cancer stage.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Not Determinable""}"
18,"## Answer

- The tumor is a well-differentiated papillary adenocarcinoma measuring 50 mm.
- The tumor extends to the visceral pleura but does not invade it.
- The bronchial resection level is tumor-free.
- Tumor classification is given as M-8140/3, G1, pT2, pN0, pMX.
- The report mentions ""stage I B"" and ""R 0"" (indicating no residual tumor).

According to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system:

- ""pT2"" indicates a tumor size greater than 3 cm but 5 cm or less, or a tumor that involves the main bronchus without involvement of the carina, invades visceral pleura, or is associated with atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis that extends to the hilar region but does not involve the entire lung.
- ""pN0"" indicates no regional lymph node metastasis.
- ""pMX"" indicates that distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

The report explicitly states ""stage I B,"" which aligns with the AJCC staging for a pT2, pN0, pMX tumor.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
19,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging:

1. **Tumor Size and Characteristics**: The primary tumor is an adenocarcinoma located in the left upper lobe of the lung, measuring 4.5 cm. It is poorly differentiated and unifocal. There is visceral pleural invasion and lymphovascular space invasion, but the tumor is confined to the lung.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: A total of six lymph nodes were examined, and one contained metastatic carcinoma. There is extracapsular extension with invasion of the adjacent artery wall.

3. **TNM Staging**: The report provides a pTNM stage of pT2aN1MX. 
   - **T2a**: Tumor size is greater than 3 cm but 5 cm or less, or tumor involves the main bronchus or invades visceral pleura.
   - **N1**: Metastasis in ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes and intrapulmonary nodes, including involvement by direct extension.
   - **MX**: Distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Based on the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for lung cancer:
- **Stage I**: Typically involves T1 or T2a with N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis).
- **Stage II**: Involves T1 or T2a with N1 (metastasis to ipsilateral lymph nodes).
- **Stage III**: Involves more extensive lymph node involvement (N2 or N3) or larger/more invasive tumors (T3 or T4).
- **Stage IV**: Involves distant metastasis (M1).

Given the information:
- The tumor is T2a (size and pleural invasion).
- There is N1 lymph node involvement.
- Distant metastasis is not assessed (MX), but there is no indication of distant metastasis in the report.

Therefore, the cancer is classified as Stage II based on the T2aN1 classification.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
20,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to consider several factors from the pathology report, including tumor size, lymph node involvement, and metastasis. 

1. **Tumor Size**: The tumor size is given as 2.5 x 1.5 x 3 cm. According to the AJCC staging for lung cancer, a tumor size of 3 cm or less typically corresponds to T1.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report states ""Lymph nodes: Not specified."" Without information on lymph node involvement, we cannot assume any nodal metastasis (N0).

3. **Distant Metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so we assume M0.

4. **Histologic Type and Grade**: The histologic type is bronchiolo-alveolar adenocarcinoma, and it is poorly differentiated. While histologic grade can influence prognosis, it does not directly affect the AJCC staging.

5. **Other Factors**: The report does not specify tumor extent, lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, or margins, which are important for a more detailed staging but are not provided here.

Based on the information provided, the tumor is likely T1N0M0, which corresponds to Stage I according to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
21,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information:

1. **Primary Tumor (pT):** The tumor is classified as pT1b, which indicates a tumor size greater than 2 cm but 3 cm or less in greatest dimension.

2. **Lymph Nodes (pN):** The report indicates that there are five negative lymph nodes (0/5), meaning no regional lymph node metastasis is identified. This corresponds to pN0.

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM):** There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, which implies pM0.

4. **Margins and Invasion:** The margins of resection are negative, and there is no direct extension of the tumor, venous invasion, arterial invasion, or lymphatic invasion identified.

Based on the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for lung cancer:

- **Stage I:** Typically includes T1a-c, N0, M0.
- **Stage II:** Typically includes T1a-c, N1, M0 or T2a-b, N0, M0.
- **Stage III:** Typically includes T1a-c, N2, M0 or T2a-b, N1-2, M0, etc.
- **Stage IV:** Involves any T, any N, M1.

Given the tumor size (pT1b), no lymph node involvement (pN0), and no distant metastasis (pM0), the cancer is classified as Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
22,"## Answer
The pathology report provides several key pieces of information that are crucial for determining the AJCC stage of the cancer:

1. **Tumor Size and Location**: The primary tumor is described as poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with a size of 1.7 cm. It is located in the right upper lobe of the lung.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: There is evidence of metastatic carcinoma in multiple lymph nodes, including level 7, level 12, and R4. The report mentions ""metastatic poorly differentiated with form of capsular penetration"" and ""metastatic adenocarcinoma to 2 cm peribronchial lymph node.""

3. **Distant Metastasis**: The report uses the designation ""pT1N2MX,"" which indicates that the primary tumor is T1 (tumor â‰¤3 cm in greatest dimension), there is N2 lymph node involvement (metastasis to ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes), and MX (distant metastasis cannot be assessed).

4. **AJCC Staging**: According to the AJCC 8th Edition for lung cancer, a T1N2 classification corresponds to Stage IIIA. This is because the tumor is small (T1), but there is significant lymph node involvement (N2), which elevates the stage to IIIA despite the absence of confirmed distant metastasis (MX).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
23,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging:

1. **Primary Tumor (pT):** The tumor is classified as pT1a, which indicates a tumor that is 2 cm or less in greatest dimension, surrounded by lung or visceral pleura, without bronchoscopic evidence of invasion more proximal than the lobar bronchus.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN):** The classification is pN0, indicating no regional lymph node metastasis. All lymph nodes examined were negative for malignancy.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, which implies M0 (no distant metastasis).

Based on the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for lung cancer:

- **Stage I** is characterized by a small tumor (T1) with no lymph node involvement (N0) and no distant metastasis (M0).

Given the tumor size (2.0 cm), lack of lymph node involvement, and absence of distant metastasis, the cancer is classified as Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
24,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to consider the TNM classification provided in the pathology report:

1. **Tumor Size and Extent (T):** The report states ""pT2b"". According to the AJCC 8th edition for lung cancer, T2b indicates a tumor size greater than 5 cm but 7 cm or less, or a tumor that involves the main bronchus without involvement of the carina, invades visceral pleura, or is associated with atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis that extends to the hilar region but does not involve the entire lung. In this case, the tumor size is 6.5 cm, which fits the T2b category.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):** The report states ""pN1 (6/28)"". N1 indicates metastasis in ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes and intrapulmonary nodes, including involvement by direct extension.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** The report states ""pMx"", which means that the presence of distant metastasis cannot be assessed. However, for staging purposes, we typically assume M0 (no distant metastasis) unless otherwise specified.

4. **Grade (G):** The report mentions ""G3"", indicating a high-grade tumor, but this does not directly affect the AJCC stage.

Based on the TNM classification:
- T2b
- N1
- M0 (assumed)

According to the AJCC 8th edition for lung cancer, a combination of T2b, N1, and M0 corresponds to Stage IIB.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
25,"## Answer
The pathology report provides detailed information about the cancer diagnosis, including tumor size, lymph node involvement, and other relevant factors. Let's break down the key points:

1. **Primary Tumor (T):**
   - The larger tumor in the left upper lobe is described as invasive adenocarcinoma with a size of 5.0 x 4.1 x 2.4 cm. It invades into but not through the pleura, which corresponds to T2.
   - The smaller tumor in the left lower lobe is 1.0 cm, corresponding to T1.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):**
   - There is extensive lymph node involvement. Eight of twelve lymph nodes in the left lung #6 are positive, four of four in the left lung #10, and two of two in the left lung AP window are positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma.
   - The report indicates N2 involvement, which means metastasis to ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):**
   - The report states MX, meaning distant metastasis cannot be assessed. However, there is no mention of confirmed distant metastasis.

Based on the AJCC staging system:
- T2, N2, MX for the larger tumor and T1, N2, MX for the smaller tumor both suggest Stage III cancer, as Stage III involves N2 lymph node involvement without confirmed distant metastasis.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
26,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging:

1. **Tumor Size and Location**: The tumor is located in the left upper lobe of the lung, is 3.5 cm in size, and is classified as adenocarcinoma. The TNM classification indicates pT2a, which corresponds to a tumor size greater than 3 cm but 5 cm or less, or a tumor that involves the main bronchus without involvement of the carina, invades visceral pleura, or is associated with atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis that extends to the hilar region but does not involve the entire lung.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report indicates pN1, meaning there is metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes and intrapulmonary nodes, including involvement by direct extension. Specifically, 2 of 2 peribronchial nodes are positive for metastatic tumor, and 1 hilar node is positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma.

3. **Distant Metastasis**: The report states pMX, indicating that distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Based on the TNM classification:
- T2a indicates a tumor size and characteristics that are consistent with Stage II or higher.
- N1 indicates regional lymph node involvement, which is consistent with Stage II or III.
- The absence of confirmed distant metastasis (MX) does not automatically elevate the stage to IV.

Considering the combination of T2a and N1, the cancer is classified as Stage II according to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
27,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information:

1. **Tumor Size and Location**: The tumor is located in the left upper lobe and measures 3.5 x 2.8 x 2.5 cm.
2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: Metastatic adenocarcinoma is present in peribronchial lymph nodes and lymph nodes labeled 11L and #5. Lymph nodes 10L and 12L are negative for neoplasm.
3. **Margins and Invasion**: The tumor invades into the visceral pleura, but the bronchial margin is negative for tumor. Vascular invasion is not identified, and lymphatic invasion is pending.
4. **AJCC Pathologic Stage**: The report explicitly states the pathologic stage as pT2a N2 MX, which corresponds to Stage IIIA according to the AJCC staging system.

The AJCC staging system for lung cancer considers the size and extent of the primary tumor (T), the involvement of regional lymph nodes (N), and the presence of distant metastasis (M). In this case:
- **T2a**: Tumor size is greater than 3 cm but 5 cm or less, or involves the main bronchus, invades visceral pleura, or is associated with atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis.
- **N2**: Metastasis to ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes.
- **MX**: Distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Given these details, the pathologic stage of the cancer is Stage IIIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
28,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information:

1. **Tumor Size and Invasion**: The tumor is a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma measuring 58 mm in maximum dimension. It invades through the visceral pleura and involves the chest wall fibrous connective tissue, but does not involve the rib bone or soft tissue resection margin.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: There is no evidence of lymph node metastases. Both hilar and peri-oesophageal lymph nodes show reactive changes only, with no malignancy.

3. **Distant Metastasis**: The report does not provide any information on distant metastasis (MX).

4. **Staging Information**: The report provides a staging of T3N0MX. 

- **T3** indicates a tumor that is more than 5 cm but less than 7 cm, or a tumor that invades the chest wall, diaphragm, phrenic nerve, mediastinal pleura, or parietal pericardium, but not the rib bone.
- **N0** indicates no regional lymph node metastasis.
- **MX** indicates that distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

According to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for lung cancer:

- **Stage I**: T1 or T2, N0, M0
- **Stage II**: T1 or T2, N1, M0 or T3, N0, M0
- **Stage III**: T3, N1 or N2, M0 or T4, any N, M0
- **Stage IV**: Any T, any N, M1

Given the information, the tumor is classified as T3N0MX. Since there is no lymph node involvement (N0) and no evidence of distant metastasis (MX), the cancer is classified as Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
29,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following information:

- Tumor size: 6.00 cm
- Pathologic T stage: T2, NOS (Not Otherwise Specified)
- Pathologic N stage: N1
- Pathologic M stage: M0

According to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system:

- T2 indicates a tumor size greater than 3 cm but 7 cm or less, or a tumor that involves the main bronchus, visceral pleura, or causes atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis extending to the hilar region.
- N1 indicates metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes and intrapulmonary nodes.
- M0 indicates no distant metastasis.

Combining these, T2 N1 M0 corresponds to Stage II cancer in the AJCC staging system for lung cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
30,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the lung adenocarcinoma from the pathology report, we need to consider the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and any distant metastasis.

1. **Tumor Size**: The tumor is described as being up to 3.5 x 3 cm. According to AJCC staging for lung cancer, a tumor size of 3 cm or less is typically classified as T1, and a tumor size greater than 3 cm but not more than 5 cm is classified as T2.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report states that 0 out of 7 hilar lymph nodes are positive for metastasis. This indicates that there is no regional lymph node involvement (N0).

3. **Distant Metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so we assume M0 (no distant metastasis).

Based on the above information:
- The tumor size suggests a T2 classification (since it is greater than 3 cm but not more than 5 cm).
- There is no lymph node involvement (N0).
- There is no distant metastasis (M0).

According to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer:
- T2 N0 M0 corresponds to Stage IB.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
31,"## Answer
The pathology report provides detailed information about the cancer diagnosis and staging. Let's break down the key points:

1. **Tumor Characteristics**: 
   - The primary tumor is located in the right upper lobe of the lung.
   - There are separate tumor nodules in the same lobe, with the largest tumor measuring 3.7 cm in greatest dimension.
   - The histologic type is adenocarcinoma, with no visceral pleural invasion or lymph-vascular invasion identified.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**:
   - A total of 11 lymph nodes were examined, and none were found to be involved with malignancy (0/11).

3. **Pathologic Staging**:
   - The report explicitly states the pathologic staging as Stage IIB, with a classification of pT3, pN0, and pM not applicable.
   - pT3 indicates a tumor greater than 5 cm or with separate tumor nodules in the same lobe.
   - pN0 indicates no regional lymph node metastasis.
   - pM not applicable suggests no distant metastasis was assessed or found.

4. **AJCC Staging**:
   - According to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system, Stage IIB lung cancer is characterized by a T3 tumor with no lymph node involvement (N0) and no distant metastasis (M0).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
32,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging:

1. **Primary Tumor (T):** The tumor is greater than 3 cm in greatest dimension, which corresponds to T2.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):** There are metastases in ipsilateral peribronchial and ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes, which corresponds to N1.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** The report states MX, meaning distant metastasis cannot be assessed, but there is no indication of distant metastasis being present.

According to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for lung cancer:

- **Stage I** typically involves T1 or T2 tumors with N0 (no regional lymph node involvement) and M0 (no distant metastasis).
- **Stage II** involves T1 or T2 tumors with N1 (metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial and/or hilar lymph nodes) and M0.
- **Stage III** involves more advanced T or N categories, such as T3 or N2.
- **Stage IV** involves any T, any N, and M1 (distant metastasis present).

Given the information:
- T2 (tumor > 3 cm)
- N1 (metastasis to ipsilateral lymph nodes)
- MX (distant metastasis cannot be assessed, but no evidence of M1)

The cancer corresponds to **Stage II** based on the T2N1M0 classification.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
33,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to consider the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and presence of distant metastasis.

1. **Tumor Size (T):** The primary tumor measures 2.5 cm in greatest dimension. According to AJCC staging, a tumor size of 2.5 cm falls under T1 (specifically T1b, which is for tumors >2 cm but â‰¤3 cm).

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N):** The pathology report indicates that there is no evidence of metastasis in the lymph nodes examined (0/2 in the right lower lobe, 0/4 in level 12, 0/7 in level 7, 0/3 in level 11, and no nodes identified in level 9). This corresponds to N0, meaning no regional lymph node metastasis.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** The report states ""Distant metastasis (pM): Cannot be evaluated by this specimen (pMX)."" However, there is no indication of distant metastasis in the provided information, so we assume M0 for staging purposes.

Based on the above information:
- T1b (tumor size 2.5 cm)
- N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis)
- M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC staging system, a T1b, N0, M0 classification corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
34,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to consider the TNM classification provided in the pathology report:

1. **Primary Tumor (pT):** The report states ""Primary tumor (pT): The tumor measures 3.5 cm in maximum dimension and is limited to the lung parenchyma in the wedge specimen and invades into the pleura, pT2."" According to AJCC staging, a tumor that is more than 3 cm but 5 cm or less, or a tumor that invades the visceral pleura, is classified as T2.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN):** The report indicates ""Regional lymph nodes (pN): pNX,"" meaning the regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed. In the absence of lymph node involvement information, we assume no lymph node metastasis for staging purposes, which would be N0.

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM):** The report states ""Distant metastasis (pM): pMX,"" meaning distant metastasis cannot be assessed. In the absence of information, we assume no distant metastasis for staging purposes, which would be M0.

Based on the information provided:
- T2 (tumor size and pleural invasion)
- N0 (no lymph node involvement assumed)
- M0 (no distant metastasis assumed)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system for lung cancer, a T2, N0, M0 classification corresponds to Stage IIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
35,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information:

1. **Tumor Size and Characteristics**: The tumor is a 2.8 cm invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with angiolymphatic and visceral pleural invasion. This corresponds to a T2 classification in the TNM staging system, as T2 tumors are greater than 3 cm but less than or equal to 5 cm, or have certain features such as visceral pleural invasion.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: All sampled lymph nodes are benign, indicating no regional lymph node metastasis. This corresponds to N0 in the TNM staging system.

3. **Distant Metastasis**: The report states MX, meaning distant metastasis cannot be assessed. However, there is no evidence provided in the report of distant metastasis.

Given the TNM classification of T2N0MX, we can determine the stage:

- **Stage I**: T1-2, N0, M0
- **Stage II**: T1-2, N1, M0 or T2b, N0, M0
- **Stage III**: T1-2, N2, M0 or T3, N0-1, M0
- **Stage IV**: Any T, Any N, M1

Since the tumor is T2, N0, and there is no evidence of distant metastasis (M0 assumed due to lack of evidence), this corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
36,"## Answer
The pathology report provides several key pieces of information that are relevant for staging the cancer according to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) guidelines:

1. **Tumor Size and Location**: The tumor is located in the middle lobe of the right lung and measures 5.5 x 5.0 cm. This size is significant for staging purposes.

2. **Histologic Type and Grade**: The tumor is a non-small cell carcinoma, poorly differentiated (G3).

3. **Visceral Pleural Invasion**: There is no visceral pleural invasion, which is an important factor in staging lung cancer.

4. **Tumor Extension**: The tumor extends into the fissure, but there is no mention of invasion into other structures such as the chest wall or diaphragm.

5. **Margins**: The bronchial margin is negative for tumor, and there is no squamous cell carcinoma in situ identified. Vascular, parenchymal, and pleural margins are all negative for carcinoma.

6. **Lymph Nodes**: Twelve lymph nodes were examined, and they are negative for carcinoma. This suggests no regional lymph node involvement (N0).

7. **Distant Metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis (M0).

Based on the information provided:
- The tumor size (5.5 cm) and extension into the fissure without pleural invasion or lymph node involvement suggests a T2 classification.
- The absence of lymph node involvement (N0) and distant metastasis (M0) are critical for staging.

According to the AJCC staging system for non-small cell lung cancer:
- T2, N0, M0 corresponds to Stage IIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
37,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to consider the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and any distant metastasis.

1. **Tumor Size (T):** The pathology report indicates a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with clear cell changes measuring 7 cm in the right lung. According to AJCC staging, a tumor greater than 5 cm but less than or equal to 7 cm is classified as T2b.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N):** The report states that there is no tumor seen in any of the lymph nodes examined, including mediastinal, right level 4, level 7, and peribronchial lymph nodes. This indicates N0, meaning no regional lymph node metastasis.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so we assume M0, indicating no distant metastasis.

Based on the above information:
- T2b (tumor size > 5 cm but â‰¤ 7 cm)
- N0 (no regional lymph node involvement)
- M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system for lung cancer, a T2b N0 M0 classification corresponds to Stage IIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
38,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to consider the primary tumor size, lymph node involvement, and the presence of metastasis.

1. **Primary Tumor (T):** The report indicates ""PRIMARY TUMOR: pT2a: Tumor more than 3 cm but 5 cm or less."" This corresponds to a T2a classification.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):** The report states ""REGIONAL LYMPH NODES: pN1: Metastasis in ipsilateral peribronchial lymph nodes."" This indicates that there is metastasis in regional lymph nodes, specifically pN1.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, which implies M0.

Based on the AJCC 7th Edition staging system for lung cancer:
- T2a, N1, M0 corresponds to Stage IIB.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
