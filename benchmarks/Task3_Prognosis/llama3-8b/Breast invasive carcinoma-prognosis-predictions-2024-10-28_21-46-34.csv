Answer: {""Survival"": ""False""}"
73,"Here are the reasoning steps:

1. The patient has a diagnosis of bifocal poorly differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma, which is an aggressive type of breast cancer.
2. The tumor is classified as grade III, which indicates a high level of aggressiveness.
3. The tumor is staged as pT2(mult)N0L0V0R0, which means that the tumor is larger than 2 cm in size (pT2), there are multiple tumors (mult), and there is no lymph node involvement (N0), distant metastasis (L0), or vascular invasion (V0).
4. The lack of lymph node involvement and distant metastasis suggests that the cancer has not spread to other parts of the body, which is a good prognostic factor.
5. However, the presence of multiple tumors and the poorly differentiated nature of the cancer suggest that the cancer may be more aggressive and have a higher risk of recurrence.

Based on these factors, I would conclude that the patient's survival after 3.49 years is uncertain. While the lack of lymph node involvement and distant metastasis is a good prognostic factor, the aggressive nature of the cancer and the presence of multiple tumors suggest that the patient may still be at risk for recurrence and progression.
