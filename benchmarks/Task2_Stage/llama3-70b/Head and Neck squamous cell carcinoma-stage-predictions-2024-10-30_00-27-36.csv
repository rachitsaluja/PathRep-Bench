To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor (T), node (N), and metastasis (M) components.

The tumor (T) component is classified as pT4a, which indicates that the tumor has invaded the epiglottic cartilage and the hyoid bone.

The node (N) component is classified as pN2c, which indicates that there are multiple lymph nodes involved on both sides of the neck, with the largest node measuring 3.2 cm in greatest dimension.

The metastasis (M) component is classified as pMx, which indicates that there is no distant metastasis.

Based on the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a pT4a classification and a pN2c classification would correspond to Stage IV. However, since there is no distant metastasis (pMx), the final stage would be Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
1,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The diagnosis is poorly differentiated squamous carcinoma invading bone, with lymphatic and perineural invasion in the floor of mouth.
2. The tumor is close to the margin of resection, but the bone margins are free of tumor.
3. There is no tumor in the five lymph nodes examined.
4. The tumor size is not explicitly stated, but the exophytic area in the floor of mouth measures 4.0 X 3.5 X 3.0 cm.

Based on the AJCC staging system for oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma, the primary tumor (T) is classified as T4a, as it invades the bone (anterior mandible).

The lymph nodes (N) are classified as N0, as there is no evidence of lymph node metastasis.

The metastasis (M) is classified as M0, as there is no evidence of distant metastasis.

Therefore, the overall stage is determined by the T and N classifications. In this case, the stage is Stage IV (T4a, N0, M0).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IV}"
2,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size (T), regional lymph nodes (N), and distant metastasis (M).

From the pathology report, we can extract the following information:

* Tumor size (T): The tumor is 4 cm in greatest dimension, which corresponds to T2 (Tumor more than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension).
* Regional lymph nodes (N): There are metastases in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes (pN2b), with 3 out of 51 nodes involved, and focal extranodal extension is present.
* Distant metastasis (M): The report states pMX, which means distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Based on the TNM classification, the patient has a T2 tumor, N2b regional lymph nodes, and MX distant metastasis.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual, a T2N2bMX corresponds to Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IV}"
3,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor (T) is described as a 1.9 cm invasive keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma with a well-differentiated histologic grade. The extent of invasion is not specified, but angiolymphatic invasion and perineural invasion are not identified. Bone invasion is not applicable. Based on the size, the primary tumor is classified as T1 (tumor ≤ 2 cm).

2. The surgical margins are reported as 1.6 mm to the deep margin, 3 mm to the medial margin, and >1 cm to the remaining margins. This indicates that the tumor is completely excised with negative margins.

3. The lymph nodes (N) are reported as 24 lymph nodes negative for carcinoma (0/24). This indicates that there is no lymph node involvement, which is classified as N0.

4. There is no mention of distant metastases (M) in the report.

Based on the TNM classification, the patient's cancer is classified as T1N0M0, which corresponds to AJCC Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
4,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the primary tumor (pT), regional lymph nodes (pN), and distant metastasis (pM).

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The primary tumor (pT) is classified as pT2, which means the tumor is more than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension.
* There is no regional lymph node metastasis (pN0), as 27 lymph nodes were examined and none were involved.
* There is no distant metastasis (pM) mentioned in the report.

According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a pT2 classification and no regional lymph node metastasis or distant metastasis would correspond to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
5,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions ""pT2"", which indicates the primary tumor (T) is of size 2.6 x 2.6 x 1.0 cm, invading the subglottal and supraglottal regions. According to the AJCC staging system, a T2 tumor is larger than 1 cm but not more than 2 cm in greatest dimension, and may involve the supraglottis and/or glottis and/or subglottis.

2. The report also mentions ""pNO (Delphian)"", which indicates there is no regional lymph node metastasis (N0).

3. There is no mention of distant metastasis (M) in the report.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* T2 (primary tumor size and invasion)
* N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis)
* M0 (no distant metastasis, assumed since not mentioned)

According to the AJCC staging system, a T2N0M0 corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
6,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The tumor size is 5.0 x 3.0 cm, which corresponds to T3 (tumor > 4 cm or invades the larynx).
* The tumor invades the anterior space, epiglottis, and thyroid cartilage, which also supports a T3 classification.
* There is lymphovascular permeation present, which is a high-risk feature.
* The left modified radical neck dissection shows 5/42 positive lymph nodes, with the largest metastatic focus measuring 2.2 cm. This corresponds to N2b (multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes, none > 6 cm).
* There is no evidence of distant metastasis.

Based on the above findings, the AJCC stage would be:

T3 (tumor size and invasion) + N2b (lymph node involvement) = Stage IV

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IV}"
7,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Tumor size and extent**: The tumor size is 4 x 2 cm, which is a significant size. The tumor extent is described as involving the deep muscles of the tongue, which suggests a T3 tumor (T3: Tumor > 4 cm or invades adjacent structures).

2. **Lymph node involvement**: The report mentions that 1/4 of the lymph nodes are positive for metastasis, specifically in the cervical region (Cervical 1/4). This indicates N1 nodal involvement (N1: Metastasis in a single ipsilateral lymph node, ≤ 3 cm in greatest dimension).

3. **Margins and distant metastasis**: The margins are uninvolved, and there is no evidence of distant metastasis.

Considering the above factors, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* Tumor (T): T3 (tumor > 4 cm or invades adjacent structures)
* Node (N): N1 (metastasis in a single ipsilateral lymph node, ≤ 3 cm in greatest dimension)
* Metastasis (M): M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC staging system, a T3N1M0 corresponds to Stage III.

1. The primary tumor is located in the right pyriform sinus, measuring 3.5 x 1.5 x 1.1 cm, and involves the lateral wall of the larynx without bone invasion. This corresponds to a T2 tumor (tumor > 2 cm but ≤ 4 cm in greatest dimension).
2. The report mentions metastatic squamous carcinoma in multiple lymph nodes on both sides of the neck, including levels II, III, and IV. This indicates nodal involvement, which is a key factor in determining the AJCC stage.
3. The number of involved lymph nodes and their location are important for staging. In this case, there are multiple involved lymph nodes on both sides of the neck, which corresponds to an N3 nodal status (metastasis in lymph nodes > 6 cm in greatest dimension).
4. There is no evidence of distant metastasis (M0) in the report.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* T2 (primary tumor size)
* N3 (multiple involved lymph nodes > 6 cm in greatest dimension)

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the pharynx, left posterior wall, with a maximum dimension of 4.5 cm. This corresponds to a T2 tumor (T1: ≤2 cm, T2: >2 cm but ≤4 cm, T3: >4 cm, T4: invades adjacent structures).
2. The report mentions lymphovascular invasion, which does not affect the T stage.
3. There are two peritumoral deposits of squamous cell carcinoma, possibly representing two completely replaced lymph nodes. This is considered N3 disease (N3: metastasis in a lymph node >6 cm in greatest dimension).
4. The report also mentions metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in 1 of 10 right cervical lymph nodes and 5 of 10 left cervical lymph nodes. This further supports the N3 classification.
5. The margins are free of tumor, and there is no evidence of distant metastases.

Based on the above information, the TNM classification is T2N3M0.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2N3M0 classification corresponds to Stage IV.

11,"## Answer

The patient's pathology report indicates that the tumor is a squamous cell carcinoma of the left tonsil, with a greatest dimension of 5.0 cm. The carcinoma infiltrates salivary glands and skeletal muscle, including the tongue, and is extensively present at the cauterized superior aspect of the lateral surgical margin, focally at the cauterized posterior margin, closely approaching the inferolateral margin, less than 0.1 cm to the medial uvula margin, and 0.4 cm from the medial tongue margin.

The report also indicates that there are metastases in four of 35 lymph nodes, with extracapsular extension in some of the positive nodes. The largest positive node is 2.5 cm in size, and the other positive nodes are approximately 1.5 cm, 1.2 cm, and 1.1 cm in size.

Based on the AJCC 2002 staging system, the minimum pathologic stage is pT4aN2bMX. The ""pT4a"" indicates that the primary tumor is T4a, which means it has invaded the adjacent structures (in this case, the salivary glands and skeletal muscle). The ""N2b"" indicates that there are metastases in multiple lymph nodes, with extracapsular extension. The ""MX"" indicates that the presence of distant metastases cannot be assessed.

Therefore, the answer is -

13,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the primary tumor (T), regional lymph nodes (N), and distant metastases (M).

From the pathology report, we can extract the following information:

* Primary tumor (T): The tumor is located in the supraglottis with extension into the glottis, and it measures 3.6 cm in greatest dimension. It invades the mucosa of a region outside the supraglottis, which corresponds to a pT2 classification.
* Regional lymph nodes (N): There are metastases in bilateral lymph nodes, with none more than 6 cm in greatest dimension. This corresponds to a pN2c classification.
* Distant metastases (M): There is no evidence of distant metastases.

According to the AJCC staging system, a pT2 primary tumor and pN2c regional lymph nodes correspond to a Stage IV cancer.

Therefore, the answer is -

14,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the primary tumor (T), regional lymph nodes (N), and distant metastasis (M).

From the pathology report, we have:

* Primary tumor (T): pT4a, which means the tumor is larger than 4 cm and has invaded the skin.
* Regional lymph nodes (N): pNO, which means there is no regional lymph node involvement.
* Distant metastasis (M): pMX, which means distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a T4a classification and no regional lymph node involvement (N0) would be classified as Stage IVA.

However, since distant metastasis cannot be assessed (MX), we cannot rule out the possibility of distant metastasis. Therefore, the final stage would be Stage IV.

17,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report indicates that the patient has invasive squamous cell carcinoma in both the right and left aryepiglottic folds of the larynx, which suggests that the tumor is bilateral.
2. The tumor in the left aryepiglottic fold is extending into adjacent cartilage, which indicates that the tumor has invaded the cartilage.
3. There is no mention of lymph node involvement or distant metastases in the report.
4. According to the AJCC staging system for laryngeal cancer, the primary tumor (T) is classified as T3 because it has invaded the cartilage.
5. Since the tumor is bilateral, it is considered a single tumor, and the N (lymph node) classification is N0, as there is no evidence of lymph node involvement.
6. The M (distant metastasis) classification is M0, as there is no evidence of distant metastases.

Based on the T3N0M0 classification, the AJCC stage of the cancer is Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
18,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size and depth of invasion (T), lymph node involvement (N), and distant metastasis (M).

From the pathology report, we can extract the following information:

* Tumor size: 1 cm
* Depth of invasion: 0.5 cm
* Lymph node involvement: No metastatic squamous cell carcinoma identified in any of the lymph nodes (Sentinel lymph nodes #1 and #2, and lymph nodes #3 and #4)

Based on the tumor size and depth of invasion, the tumor is classified as T1 (tumor 2 cm or less in greatest dimension).

Since there is no lymph node involvement, the N stage is NO (no regional lymph node metastasis).

There is no mention of distant metastasis in the pathology report, so the M stage is MX (distant metastasis cannot be assessed).

According to the AJCC staging system, a T1 tumor with NO lymph node involvement and MX distant metastasis corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
19,"## Answer

The patient's pathology report indicates that the primary tumor (pT) is classified as pT2, which means the tumor is larger than 2 cm but not larger than 4 cm. The regional lymph nodes (pN) are classified as pN1, which means there is metastasis to a single ipsilateral lymph node, and the largest focus measures 2.4 cm. There is no distant metastasis (pM0). 

The report also mentions perineural invasion, which is a poor prognostic factor. However, it does not affect the staging. 

According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a pT2 classification, pN1 classification, and pM0 classification corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to analyze the pathology report and identify the key factors that influence staging.

From the report, we can see that the patient has a transglottic invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, moderately differentiated, with a maximum dimension of 3.8 cm. The tumor invades through the thyroid cartilage and into the anterior soft tissue.

The tumor stage (T) is pT4a, which indicates that the tumor has invaded through the thyroid cartilage and into the anterior soft tissue.

The lymph node stage (N) is pNO, which means that there is no evidence of lymph node metastasis.

The metastasis stage (M) is pMX, which means that the presence or absence of distant metastases cannot be assessed.

Based on these factors, we can determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

Therefore, the answer is -

* Perineural invasion: Present, focal
* Vascular invasion: Absent
* Lymph node involvement: None (all lymph nodes in levels I, II, and III are negative for tumor)
* Distant metastasis: Not mentioned in the report, so we assume it's not present

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system for oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma, the T category is T2 (tumor size 3 cm in largest dimension). The N category is N0 (no lymph node involvement). Since there is no distant metastasis, the M category is M0.

Therefore, the overall stage is Stage II (T2N0M0).

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Primary tumor (T): The tumor measures 5.0 x 3.8 x 3.0 cm and extends to within 3.0 mm of the medial/inferior soft tissue margin. It obliterates the gingival-buccal sulcus and the floor of the mouth. This suggests a large tumor that has invaded the mandible and extended to the skin and deep dermis. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual, this would correspond to a T4a tumor, which is a tumor that invades the cortical bone, inferior alveolar nerve, floor of the mouth, or skin of the face.

2. Regional lymph nodes (N): The pathology report indicates that 22 lymph nodes were examined, and none of them showed evidence of metastatic disease. This suggests that the regional lymph nodes are negative for cancer, which corresponds to an N0 classification.

3. Distant metastasis (M): There is no mention of distant metastasis in the pathology report, which suggests that the cancer has not spread to distant organs or tissues. This corresponds to an M0 classification.

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the cancer:

1. Primary site: Larynx - This indicates the primary tumor is located in the larynx.
2. Tumor size: 5.5 cm - This is a significant size, but we need to consider other factors to determine the T stage.
3. Ulceration: present - This is a negative prognostic factor.
4. Mucosa, cartilage plan, and skeletal muscle invasion - This indicates the tumor has invaded local structures, which is a T4a factor.
5. Lymphatic invasion: present - This is a negative prognostic factor.
6. Metastasis in two lymph nodes without capsular involvement among eleven lymph nodes (2/11) - This indicates N2b disease, as there are multiple lymph nodes involved on the same side of the neck as the primary tumor.
7. No distant metastases are mentioned in the report.

Based on the above factors, we can determine the TNM stages as follows:

* T stage: T4a (due to invasion of local structures)

* Primary tumor (pT): The tumor is 2.7 x 2.6 x 0.7 cm in size, which corresponds to pT2 (tumor more than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension).
* Regional lymph nodes (pN): There are 2 out of 18 level II lymph nodes positive for metastasis, which corresponds to pN2b (metastasis in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes, none more than 6 cm in greatest dimension).
* Distant metastasis (pM): Not applicable, as there is no evidence of distant metastasis.

Based on the AJCC staging system, the patient's stage is determined by the combination of pT, pN, and pM. In this case, the patient has pT2, pN2b, and pM0, which corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
34,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor size is 2.6 x 2.2 x 2.1 cm, which is less than 4 cm in greatest dimension. According to the AJCC staging system, this corresponds to a T2 tumor.
2. The tumor invades the mandible, which is a deep tissue structure. This is considered a T4a tumor, which takes precedence over the T2 size classification.
3. The tumor extends to the right lingual surgical resection margin, but the new right lingual margin is free of tumor. This suggests that the tumor has not spread to lymph nodes or distant sites.
4. There is no evidence of lymph node involvement or distant metastasis in the report.

Based on these findings, the tumor is classified as T4aN0M0.

According to the AJCC staging system, a T4aN0M0 tumor corresponds to Stage IVA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IVA}"
35,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to analyze the pathology report and identify the key features that affect staging.

From the report, we can see that the patient has a laryngeal carcinoma, specifically a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, located in the right supraglottis and pyriform sinus, extending into the thyroid cartilage. The tumor measures 4.5 cm in maximum dimension.

The report also indicates that there is perineural invasion and angiolymphatic invasion present. Additionally, one of the 56 lymph nodes examined is positive for metastatic disease, specifically in the right level 3 lymph node, which measures 3.1 cm.

The surgical margins of resection are free of tumor, and there is no extracapsular spread present.

Using the AJCC staging system, we can determine the T stage, N stage, and M stage as follows:

* T stage: The tumor is classified as T4a, as it extends into the thyroid cartilage.
* N stage: The presence of a single positive lymph node in the right level 3 lymph node, measuring 3.1 cm, corresponds to an N2a stage.
* M stage: There is no evidence of distant metastases, so the M stage is MX.

Based on these stages, we can determine the overall AJCC stage of the cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IV}"
36,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size (T), lymph node involvement (N), and distant metastasis (M).

From the pathology report, we can gather the following information:

* Tumor size (T): The tumor measures 3.5 cm in greatest dimension, which corresponds to T2 (tumor > 2 cm but ≤ 4 cm).
* Lymph node involvement (N): There is metastatic carcinoma in one of 26 lymph nodes (1/11 level II lymph nodes and 0/15 level III lymph nodes), which corresponds to N1 (metastasis in a single ipsilateral lymph node, ≤ 3 cm in greatest dimension).
* Distant metastasis (M): There is no evidence of distant metastasis, which corresponds to M0.

According to the AJCC staging manual (6th edition, 2002), the minimal pTNM classification is pT2, pN1, pMx. Based on this classification, the AJCC stage is Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
37,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor's primary site, size, invasion, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can identify the following key features:

1. Primary site: The tumor is located in the tongue (left partial glossectomy and pharyngectomy).
2. Size: The tumor measures 2.0 X 1.5 cm on the surface and 1.2 cm in depth.
3. Invasion: The tumor shows focal perineural invasion.
4. Lymph node involvement: Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma is present in 1 of 2 lymph nodes.
5. Distant metastasis: There is no evidence of distant metastasis.

Based on the AJCC staging system for oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma, we can assign the following stage:

* Tumor size (T): T2 (2 cm in greatest dimension)
* Lymph node involvement (N): N1 (metastasis in a single ipsilateral lymph node)
* Distant metastasis (M): M0 (no distant metastasis)

Therefore, the AJCC stage is Stage III (T2N1M0).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
38,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the primary tumor (pT), regional lymph nodes (pN), and distant metastasis (pM).

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The primary tumor (pT) is classified as pT3, as it measures more than 4 cm in greatest dimension.
* The regional lymph nodes (pN) are classified as pN2b, as there are metastases in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes, none more than 6 cm in greatest dimension.
* There is no distant metastasis (pM).

According to the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 7th edition, 2010, the stage is determined by the combination of pT, pN, and pM. In this case, the stage is:

pT3 pN2b pM0

Therefore, the answer is:

(C) Stage III"
39,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the primary tumor (pT), regional lymph nodes (pN), and distant metastasis (pM).

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The primary tumor (pT) is classified as pT4a, which indicates that the tumor has invaded the bone (mandible).
* The regional lymph nodes (pN) are classified as pNO, which means that none of the 44 regional lymph nodes examined were involved with tumor.
* There is no mention of distant metastasis (pM), so it is classified as pMX, which means that the presence or absence of distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a pT4a classification and pNO lymph nodes would correspond to Stage IVa. However, since there is no evidence of distant metastasis, we cannot classify it as Stage IV. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Therefore, the answer is - {""stage"" : Stage III}"
40,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor size is 5 cm, which is a significant factor in determining the T stage. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual, a tumor size of 5 cm corresponds to a T3 stage (T1: ≤2 cm, T2: >2 cm but ≤4 cm, T3: >4 cm but ≤7 cm, T4: >7 cm).

2. The tumor is localized, with no evidence of distant metastases (M0). The presence of venous invasion is not a factor in determining the M stage.

3. There are six lymph nodes in the fatty tissue from the right side, but they have a normal morphological structure, indicating no lymph node involvement (N0).

4. Based on the T3 stage and N0 stage, we can determine the overall stage. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual, a T3N0M0 corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
41,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can see that the tumor is an invasive poorly differentiated squamous carcinoma located in the mandible, with involvement of the floor of the mouth and partial glossectomy. The tumor size is not explicitly stated, but we can infer that it is at least 1.5 cm in size based on the description of the ulcerated lesion.

There is no evidence of lymph node involvement or distant metastasis in the report. However, perineural invasion and questionable lymphatics are mentioned, which may indicate a higher risk of lymph node involvement.

Based on the TNM staging system, the tumor size (T) is at least T2 (2-4 cm), and there is no evidence of lymph node involvement (N0) or distant metastasis (M0).

Therefore, the AJCC stage of the cancer is Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
42,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The diagnosis is moderately-differentiated invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the right tongue, with invasion into the deep tongue muscles and no invasion into the mandible.
2. The tumor size is 5.0 cm in greatest dimension, and all margins are negative.
3. There is no lymph node involvement (pNo) based on the examination of 16 lymph nodes.
4. The tumor has invaded the deep tongue muscles, which corresponds to a T4a classification.

According to the AJCC staging system, a T4a classification corresponds to a Stage IVA (pT4a, pNo).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IVA}"
43,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, invasion, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The tumor size is 3.4 cm in largest dimension, which corresponds to T2 (Tumor more than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension).
* The tumor has invaded to a depth of 1.4 cm, which does not affect the T stage.
* There is no lymph node involvement, as all lymph nodes from levels I to IV are negative for tumor (0/6, 0/10, 0/18, and 0/9, respectively).
* There is no mention of distant metastasis.

According to the AJCC staging system, a T2 tumor with no lymph node involvement and no distant metastasis corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
44,"## Answer

The patient's pathology report indicates that the tumor is an invasive squamous cell carcinoma, moderately differentiated, measuring 3.0 cm in greatest dimension, involving the bilateral inferior epiglottis and extending through the epiglottis into the pre-epiglottic space. The thyroid cartilage is not present.

The report also states that 19 lymph nodes from the left levels 2, 3, and 4, 5 lymph nodes from the right level 2, 1 lymph node from the left level 1, and 11 lymph nodes from the supraglottic larynx were dissected and found to be negative for malignancy.

Based on this information, the tumor is classified as T3 (tumor > 4 cm or invades adjacent structures) and N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis). The M category is not specified in the report, but it is assumed to be MX (distant metastasis cannot be assessed) since there is no mention of distant metastasis.

According to the AJCC staging system, a T3N0MX tumor corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
