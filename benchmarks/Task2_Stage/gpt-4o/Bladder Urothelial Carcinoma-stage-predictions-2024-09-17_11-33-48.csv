The pathology report indicates the presence of invasive poorly differentiated papillary urothelial carcinoma in the bladder. The tumor measures 5 x 4 x 3 cm and extends through the bladder wall into the perivesical soft tissue, which corresponds to a T3b classification. There is no evidence of malignancy in any of the 48 lymph nodes examined, indicating N0 classification. The M classification is MX, meaning distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

According to the AJCC staging system for bladder cancer:
- Stage I: T1, N0, M0
- Stage II: T2, N0, M0
- Stage III: T3a/b or T4a, N0, M0 or T1-4a, N1, M0
- Stage IV: T4b, N0, M0 or any T, N2-3, M0 or any T, any N, M1

Given the classification of pT3bN0MX, the cancer is at Stage III, as it involves invasion into perivesical tissue (T3b) without lymph node involvement (N0) and unknown distant metastasis (MX).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
1,"## Answer
The pathology report provides a detailed analysis of the bladder and prostate cancer. The key findings for staging the bladder cancer are:

1. **Bladder Cancer**: 
   - The tumor is described as invasive transitional cell carcinoma, grade 3-4/4, with squamous differentiation.
   - It extends through the muscularis propria and into the perivesical fat.
   - The radial margin is free of tumor, and no lymphovascular space invasion is identified.
   - The pathologic TNM stage for the bladder is given as pT3bN0MX.

2. **Prostate Cancer**:
   - Unilateral prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason's score 6 (3+3), involving the left distal prostate.
   - Tumor does not involve the capsule or periprostatic soft tissue.
   - Pathologic TNM stage for the prostate is pT2aN0MX.

3. **Lymph Nodes**:
   - No metastatic carcinoma identified in 77 lymph nodes examined (0/77).

The AJCC staging for bladder cancer is based on the TNM classification:
- **T3b**: Tumor invades perivesical tissue (macroscopic extravesical mass).
- **N0**: No regional lymph node metastasis.
- **M0**: No distant metastasis (MX indicates that distant metastasis cannot be assessed, but no evidence of metastasis is provided).

Based on the TNM classification, the bladder cancer is staged as Stage III. The prostate cancer findings do not alter the overall staging of the bladder cancer in this context.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
2,"## Answer
The pathology report provides detailed information about the cancer staging based on the AJCC TNM system. Let's break down the key findings:

1. **Primary Tumor (pT):** The report indicates ""pT3a,"" which means the tumor invades into the perivesical fat. According to the AJCC staging system, pT3a is indicative of a more advanced local invasion beyond the bladder wall.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN):** The report states ""pN1,"" which indicates there is a single regional lymph node metastasis. This suggests that the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes, which is a critical factor in staging.

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM):** The report mentions ""Not applicable"" for distant metastasis, implying there is no evidence of distant spread (pM0).

Based on the TNM classification:
- **pT3a** indicates the tumor has invaded into the perivesical fat.
- **pN1** indicates metastasis to a single regional lymph node.
- **pM0** indicates no distant metastasis.

According to the AJCC staging system, a combination of pT3a, pN1, and pM0 corresponds to **Stage III** cancer. Stage III typically involves local advancement with regional lymph node involvement but no distant metastasis.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
3,"## Answer

16,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging the urothelial carcinoma of the bladder:

1. **Tumor Invasion (T Stage):** The tumor is described as ""ulcerated, invasive urothelial carcinoma, high-grade"" that ""infiltrates through the muscularis propria with extension (grossly evident) into the perivesical adipose tissue."" This corresponds to a T3b stage, where the tumor has extended into the perivesical fat.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N Stage):** There is a ""microscopic focus of metastatic urothelial carcinoma present in one perivesical lymph node (1/1)."" This indicates N1 stage, where there is metastasis in a single regional lymph node.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M Stage):** The report states ""MX,"" meaning distant metastasis cannot be assessed. However, for staging purposes, we consider the information available, which does not indicate confirmed distant metastasis.

Based on the TNM classification:
- T3b indicates the tumor has invaded into the perivesical tissue.
- N1 indicates regional lymph node involvement.
- MX indicates that distant metastasis cannot be assessed, but no evidence of distant metastasis is provided.

According to the AJCC staging system for bladder cancer:
- Stage III is characterized by T3b or T4a with N0 or N1 and M0.

Therefore, given the T3b, N1, and MX (assuming M0 due to lack of evidence of distant metastasis), the cancer is classified as Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
17,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the bladder cancer from the pathology report, we need to consider the extent of tumor invasion and other pathological findings:

1. **Right Lateral Bladder Wall**:
   - Tumor Type: Invasive urothelial carcinoma.
   - Local Invasion: Invasion into the lamina propria (focal and superficial).
   - Muscularis Propria: Not involved.
   - Vascular Invasion: Not identified.

   The involvement of the lamina propria without invasion into the muscularis propria corresponds to a T1 classification.

2. **Left Bladder Neck Resection**:
   - Tumor Type: Invasive urothelial carcinoma.
   - Local Invasion: Invasion into the muscularis propria.
   - Vascular Invasion: Identified.

   The involvement of the muscularis propria corresponds to at least a T2 classification. The presence of vascular invasion and involvement of peri-urethral glands suggests a more advanced local spread, potentially indicating T3 or higher, but the key determinant here is the muscularis propria involvement, which is T2.

Given these findings, the most advanced stage based on the muscularis propria involvement is T2, which corresponds to Stage II in the AJCC staging system for bladder cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
18,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information:

1. **Primary Tumor (T):** The tumor is described as extending through the muscularis propria into the perivesical fat and extending to the peritoneum. This corresponds to a T3b classification, where the tumor invades perivesical tissue and extends to the peritoneum.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):** Metastatic carcinoma is identified in six of the 71 lymph nodes examined. Specifically, metastatic carcinoma is found in the left pelvic lymph nodes (3/3), right common iliac lymph nodes (2/10), and right obturator/hypogastric lymph nodes (2/13). This corresponds to an N2 classification, indicating metastasis in multiple regional lymph nodes.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** The report does not provide information on distant metastasis (MX), meaning it is unknown.

Based on the AJCC staging system for bladder cancer:
- **Stage III** is characterized by T3b or T4a with N0 or N1.
- **Stage IV** is characterized by any T with N2 or N3, or any T with any N and M1.

Given the T3bN2MX classification, the presence of N2 (metastasis in multiple regional lymph nodes) indicates that the cancer is at least Stage IV, regardless of the M classification.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IV""}"
19,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging the cancer according to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) system:

1. **Primary Tumor (pT):** The report indicates a pT4a stage, which means the tumor invades the prostatic stroma. According to the AJCC staging system, pT4a indicates that the tumor has invaded nearby structures such as the prostate, uterus, or vagina.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN):** The report states pN0, meaning there is no regional lymph node metastasis. Eight lymph nodes were examined, and none were involved.

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM):** The report mentions that distant metastasis is not applicable, which typically means there is no evidence of distant metastasis (pM0).

Based on the AJCC staging system for bladder cancer:

{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
24,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging the urothelial carcinoma:

1. **Primary Tumor (T):** The report indicates ""pT3a,"" which means the tumor has invaded into the extravesicular fat but not beyond. This corresponds to a T3 stage in the AJCC staging system.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):** The report states ""N2,"" which indicates that there is metastasis in 5 or more regional lymph nodes. Specifically, 5 out of 29 lymph nodes are positive for metastatic urothelial carcinoma, with extranodal extension noted.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** The report lists ""MX,"" meaning that the presence of distant metastasis cannot be assessed. However, the presence of extranodal extension and multiple lymph node involvement suggests advanced disease.

Given the information:
- T3a indicates the tumor has extended into the perivesical tissue.
- N2 indicates significant lymph node involvement.
- MX indicates that distant metastasis cannot be assessed, but the extensive lymph node involvement and extranodal extension suggest a more advanced stage.

In the AJCC staging system, a combination of T3a and N2 typically corresponds to Stage IV, especially considering the extranodal extension and multiple lymph node involvement.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IV""}"
25,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging the cancer:

1. **Tumor Type and Grade**: The tumor is an invasive high-grade urothelial carcinoma with focal sarcomatoid differentiation.

2. **Depth of Invasion**: The tumor invades through the bladder wall into the perivesical fat, which corresponds to a T3b classification in the TNM staging system.

3. **Lymph Node Involvement**: There is no lymph node involvement (0/40 lymph nodes are positive for tumor), which corresponds to N0.

4. **Metastasis**: The report indicates MX, meaning distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

According to the AJCC 7th edition TNM staging system for bladder cancer:

- **Stage I**: T1, N0, M0
- **Stage II**: T2, N0, M0
- **Stage III**: T3a/T3b or T4a, N0, M0
- **Stage IV**: T4b, N0, M0 or any T, N1/N2/N3, M0 or any T, any N, M1

Given the information:
- The tumor is classified as T3b due to invasion into the perivesical fat.
- There is no lymph node involvement (N0).
- Metastasis is not assessed (MX), but for staging purposes, we consider M0 unless otherwise specified.

Therefore, the cancer is classified as Stage III based on the T3b, N0, M0 classification.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
26,"## Answer
The pathology report indicates the presence of high-grade urothelial carcinoma in the urinary bladder, which is invasive into the perivesicular adipose tissue. The tumor has not extended into adjacent organs, and the surgical margins are negative. Importantly, there is no tumor found in any of the lymph nodes examined (0/25), indicating no regional lymph node metastasis. The report specifies the AJCC/UICC stage as pT3aN0.

According to the AJCC staging system for bladder cancer:
- T3a indicates that the tumor has invaded into the perivesical tissue (microscopically).
- N0 indicates no regional lymph node metastasis.
- M0 (not explicitly mentioned but implied by the absence of distant metastasis) indicates no distant metastasis.

Based on these findings, the cancer is classified as Stage III, as Stage III bladder cancer is characterized by T3a or T3b with N0 and M0.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
27,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging:

1. **Primary Tumor (T):** The report indicates ""pT3"" which means the tumor has invaded into the perivesical tissue. This corresponds to T3 in the AJCC staging system for bladder cancer.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):** The report mentions ""N1"" which indicates there is metastasis in a single regional lymph node. This corresponds to N1 in the AJCC staging system.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** The report states ""MX,"" which means distant metastasis cannot be assessed. However, the presence of nodal involvement (N1) is sufficient to consider the cancer as locally advanced.

Based on the TNM classification provided (pT3, N1, MX), the cancer is classified as Stage III according to the AJCC staging system for bladder cancer. Stage III is characterized by tumor invasion into perivesical tissue (T3) and regional lymph node involvement (N1).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
28,"## Answer
The pathology report indicates the following key findings for staging:

1. **Tumor Invasion (T):** The tumor is described as a ""poorly differentiated papillary urothelial carcinoma, grade 3/4,"" which ""invades the superficial portion of the muscularis propria."" This corresponds to a T2 stage, specifically T2a if it invades the superficial muscularis propria, or T2b if it invades the deep muscularis propria. The report specifies ""superficial part of the muscularis propria,"" which aligns with T2a, but the pathologic TNM stage provided is T2b, indicating deeper invasion.

2. **Lymph Nodes (N):** The report states ""NO MALIGNANCY IDENTIFIED IN A TOTAL OF 58 LYMPH NODES EXAMINED (0/58)."" This indicates N0, meaning no regional lymph node metastasis.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** The report does not provide evidence of distant metastasis, and the pathologic TNM stage lists MX, indicating that distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

4. **Carcinoma In Situ (Tis):** The presence of carcinoma in situ (Tis) is noted, but it does not affect the overall stage when invasive cancer is present.

Given these findings, the pathologic stage is T2bN0MX. According to the AJCC staging system for bladder cancer:

- **Stage I:** T1, N0, M0
- **Stage II:** T2a or T2b, N0, M0
- **Stage III:** T3 or T4a, N0, M0 or any T, N1, M0
- **Stage IV:** T4b, any N, M0 or any T, N2 or N3, M0 or any T, any N, M1

The patient's cancer is T2bN0MX, which corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
29,"## Answer
The pathology report provides detailed information about the cancer staging based on the TNM classification:

1. **Bladder Cancer**: 
   - **pT2b**: This indicates that the tumor has invaded the muscularis propria (muscle layer) of the bladder wall.
   - **N0**: No regional lymph node metastasis is identified.
   - **MX**: Distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

2. **Ureter Cancer**:
   - **pT3**: This indicates that the tumor has invaded through the muscularis propria into the periureteral soft tissue.
   - **N0**: No regional lymph node metastasis is identified.
   - **MK**: Distant metastasis is unknown.

The AJCC staging system for bladder cancer is as follows:
- **Stage I**: Tumor invades subepithelial connective tissue (pT1).
- **Stage II**: Tumor invades muscularis propria (pT2).
- **Stage III**: Tumor invades perivesical tissue (pT3) or adjacent organs (pT4a).
- **Stage IV**: Tumor invades pelvic or abdominal wall (pT4b) or has distant metastasis (M1).

For the bladder cancer, the classification of pT2bN0MX corresponds to Stage II, as the tumor has invaded the muscularis propria but there is no lymph node involvement or distant metastasis.

For the ureter cancer, the classification of pT3N0MK suggests a more advanced local invasion but still no lymph node involvement or confirmed distant metastasis. However, the primary focus here is on the bladder cancer staging.

Therefore, the overall stage of the cancer, considering the bladder cancer as the primary site, is Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
30,"## Answer
The pathology report provides several key pieces of information that are crucial for determining the AJCC stage of the bladder cancer:

1. **Tumor Type and Histologic Type**: The tumor is identified as an invasive urothelial carcinoma with extensive squamous differentiation.

2. **Histologic Grade**: The tumor is high grade according to WHO/ISUP classification.

3. **Tumor Configuration**: The tumor has both solid and papillary configurations.

4. **Muscularis Propria Invasion**: The report confirms that the tumor invades the muscularis propria. This is a critical factor in staging bladder cancer.

5. **Lymph-Vascular Invasion**: Present, which indicates a more aggressive tumor.

6. **AJCC Staging Information**: The report mentions ""At least pT2 pNX pM: Not applicable."" This indicates that the tumor is at least stage T2, which means it invades the muscularis propria.

7. **Lymph Node and Metastasis Status**: The report indicates pNX (regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed) and pM: Not applicable (distant metastasis not assessed).

Based on the information provided, particularly the invasion of the muscularis propria (pT2), the cancer is at least Stage II according to the AJCC staging system for bladder cancer. Stage II is characterized by the invasion of the muscularis propria (T2) without any confirmed lymph node involvement (N0) or distant metastasis (M0).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
31,"## Answer
The pathology report indicates that the bladder tumor is a high-grade urothelial carcinoma with nested features. The key details from the report are:

1. **High-Grade (Grade 3)**: This indicates a more aggressive and poorly differentiated tumor.

2. **Extensively Invasive into Muscularis Propria**: This is a critical piece of information. In the TNM staging system for bladder cancer, invasion into the muscularis propria corresponds to at least T2 stage. Specifically, T2a indicates invasion into the inner half of the muscularis propria, and T2b indicates invasion into the outer half.

3. **Suspicious for Lymphovascular Invasion**: While this suggests potential spread, it does not confirm lymph node involvement or distant metastasis, which would be necessary for Stage III or IV.

4. **No Mention of Lymph Node Involvement or Distant Metastasis**: The report does not provide evidence of lymph node involvement (N stage) or distant metastasis (M stage), which are required for higher stages.

Based on the information provided, the tumor is invasive into the muscularis propria but lacks evidence of lymph node involvement or distant metastasis. This aligns with Stage II bladder cancer, which is characterized by muscle-invasive disease without nodal or distant spread.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
32,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging:

1. **Tumor Size and Location**: The carcinoma measures 6.5 cm and is located in the posterior to the right lateral bladder wall.
2. **Tumor Invasion**: The carcinoma extends through the detrusor muscle and involves the perivesical soft tissue.
3. **Lymph Nodes**: Two left pelvic and three right pelvic lymph nodes were excised, all benign and negative for carcinoma.
4. **Margins**: All surgical margins are negative for the tumor.
5. **Lymphovascular Invasion**: Not identified.
6. **Pathologic Stage**: pT3aN0MX.

According to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for bladder cancer:

- **T3a**: The tumor invades the perivesical tissue microscopically.
- **N0**: No regional lymph node metastasis.
- **MX**: Distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Based on the provided pathologic stage of pT3aN0MX, the cancer is classified as Stage III. Stage III bladder cancer is characterized by tumor invasion into the perivesical tissue (T3) without lymph node involvement (N0) and unknown distant metastasis (MX).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
33,"## Answer
The pathology report provides detailed information about the cancer staging based on the AJCC criteria. Let's break down the key findings:

1. **Bladder Cancer**:
   - The report indicates ""invasive poorly differentiated urothelial carcinoma with squamoid features"" extending through the bladder wall into perivesical soft tissue. This is classified as pT3b, which means the tumor has invaded into perivesical tissue.
   - No lymph node metastasis is identified (N0), and distant metastasis is not assessed (MX).

2. **Prostate Cancer**:
   - The prostate cancer is described as ""bilateral prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason's score 6 (3+3), confined to prostate without transgression of capsule,"" which is classified as pT2b. This indicates the tumor is confined within the prostate.

3. **Lymph Nodes**:
   - A total of 17 lymph nodes were examined, and no malignancy was identified in any of them (0/17), confirming N0 status.

4. **Overall Staging**:
   - For bladder cancer, the staging is pT3bN0MX. According to the AJCC staging system, a pT3bN0 classification corresponds to Stage III bladder cancer, as the tumor has invaded into the perivesical tissue but there is no regional lymph node involvement or distant metastasis.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
34,"## Answer
The pathology report indicates the following key findings:

1. **Primary Tumor (pT):** pT4a - This indicates that the tumor has invaded through the bladder wall and into surrounding structures such as the perivesical fat, myometrium, endocervical stroma, and vaginal submucosa.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN):** pN2 - This indicates that there is metastasis in 5 out of 23 pelvic lymph nodes, with extranodal extension identified.

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM):** pMX - The status of distant metastasis is not assessed.

According to the AJCC staging system for urothelial carcinoma of the bladder:

- **Stage I** is characterized by a tumor that invades the subepithelial connective tissue (pT1) with no lymph node involvement (pN0) and no distant metastasis (pM0).
- **Stage II** involves a tumor that invades the muscularis propria (pT2) with no lymph node involvement (pN0) and no distant metastasis (pM0).
- **Stage III** involves a tumor that invades the perivesical tissue (pT3) or adjacent organs (pT4a) with or without regional lymph node involvement (pN1 or pN2) and no distant metastasis (pM0).
- **Stage IV** involves a tumor that invades the pelvic or abdominal wall (pT4b) or any tumor with distant metastasis (pM1).

In this case, the tumor is classified as pT4a and pN2, which corresponds to Stage III, as there is no confirmed distant metastasis (pMX).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
35,"## Answer
The pathology report indicates the presence of invasive papillary urothelial carcinoma with nuclear grade 3/4, which is multifocal and invades the deep muscle (outer half) of the bladder. The tumor also invades the urethra and vagina, although no mucosal involvement is identified. Importantly, the report specifies the pathologic TNM stage as pT4aNOMX.

- **pT4a**: This indicates that the tumor has invaded adjacent organs, such as the uterus or vagina, which is consistent with the description of invasion into the urethra and vagina.
- **N0**: No regional lymph node metastasis is identified, as no tumor is found in any of the 53 lymph nodes examined.
- **MX**: Distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

According to the AJCC staging system for bladder cancer, a pT4a classification corresponds to Stage IV, as it involves invasion into nearby organs.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IV""}"
36,"## Answer
The pathology report provides several key pieces of information that are crucial for determining the AJCC stage of the bladder cancer:

1. **Tumor Size and Invasion**: The tumor is at least 5.0 cm in greatest dimension and invades through the detrusor muscle into the perivesical adipose tissue. This indicates at least a T3 stage, as T3 involves invasion into the perivesical tissue.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: There is metastatic urothelial carcinoma in one of two right pelvic lymph nodes and six of seven left pelvic lymph nodes. This indicates N2 stage, as N2 involves metastasis in multiple regional lymph nodes.

3. **Distant Metastasis**: The report states ""pMX,"" meaning that distant metastasis cannot be assessed. However, the presence of extensive lymph node involvement suggests a higher stage.

4. **Margins and Other Invasions**: The carcinoma is present at the perivesical adipose tissue resection margin, and there is extensive angiolymphatic and focal perineural invasion, which further supports a more advanced stage.

Given these findings, the cancer is at least stage III due to the invasion into perivesical tissue and lymph node involvement. However, the extensive lymph node involvement (N2) and the presence of carcinoma at the resection margin suggest a more advanced stage. In the absence of confirmed distant metastasis (M0 or M1), the cancer is classified as Stage IV due to the N2 classification.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IV""}"
37,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging:

1. **Tumor (T) Stage**: The report indicates a TNM stage of pT3a for the bladder cancer. According to the AJCC staging system, T3a indicates that the tumor has invaded the perivesical tissue microscopically.

2. **Node (N) Stage**: The report states pN0, which means there is no regional lymph node metastasis.

3. **Metastasis (M) Stage**: The report indicates pMX, meaning distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Based on the TNM classification:
- T3a indicates the tumor has extended beyond the bladder into the surrounding tissue.
- N0 indicates no lymph node involvement.
- MX indicates that distant metastasis cannot be assessed, but there is no evidence of distant metastasis provided in the report.

According to the AJCC staging system for bladder cancer:
- Stage III is characterized by T3a or T3b with N0 and M0.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
38,"## Answer
The pathology report indicates the presence of a high-grade urothelial carcinoma with extensive small cell differentiation. The tumor is invasive into the muscularis propria, which is a key factor in staging bladder cancer. According to the AJCC staging system for bladder cancer:

- Stage I: Tumor invades the subepithelial connective tissue (lamina propria) but not the muscularis propria.
- Stage II: Tumor invades the muscularis propria.
- Stage III: Tumor invades perivesical tissue.
- Stage IV: Tumor invades adjacent structures or distant metastasis.

In this case, the tumor is invasive into the muscularis propria, which corresponds to Stage II. Additionally, the report mentions positive lymphovascular invasion, but there is no mention of invasion beyond the muscularis propria or distant metastasis, which would be necessary to consider Stage III or IV.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
39,"## Answer
The pathology report indicates the presence of high-grade urothelial carcinoma in the bladder, which invades the bladder wall transmural and extends to the perivesical fat. This suggests at least a T3 classification. The tumor does not invade the serosal surface, and there is no lymphovascular invasion. Importantly, all lymph nodes examined (left and right external iliac, obturator, and common iliac) are negative for tumor involvement, indicating N0 classification. There is no mention of distant metastasis, suggesting M0 classification.

According to the AJCC staging system for bladder cancer:
- T3 indicates the tumor invades perivesical tissue.
- N0 indicates no regional lymph node metastasis.
- M0 indicates no distant metastasis.

Based on these findings, the cancer would be classified as Stage III (T3 N0 M0).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
