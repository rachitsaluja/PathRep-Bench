Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (pT)**: The report mentions two primary tumors, one in the lingula (1 cm) and another in the left lower lobe (3.5 cm). Both tumors are adenocarcinomas with different histological subtypes. The larger tumor (3.5 cm) is classified as pT2a, as it is greater than 3 cm but less than or equal to 5 cm in greatest dimension.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN)**: The report states that four lymph nodes were negative for carcinoma (0/4), indicating that there is no regional lymph node metastasis. Therefore, pN is classified as pN0.

3. **Distant Metastases (pM)**: There is no mention of distant metastases in the report, so pM is classified as pM0.

Considering the above information, the AJCC stage of the cancer is determined as follows:

* pT2a (primary tumor size > 3 cm but ≤ 5 cm)
* pN0 (no regional lymph node metastasis)
* pM0 (no distant metastases)

According to the AJCC staging system, the stage corresponding to these descriptors is **Stage II**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage II}"
1,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the right lower lobe of the lung, and its size is 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.6 cm, which corresponds to a T2 tumor (tumor size > 2 cm but ≤ 5 cm).
2. The tumor invades the pleura, but there is no lymphovascular space invasion.
3. The surgical margin status shows that the tumor is 2.8 cm away from the bronchial margin and less than 0.5 cm away from the pleural surface, focally involving the pleura.
4. The lymph node status is N0, as all lymph nodes (stations 4, 7, 11, and 12) are negative for tumor.

Based on these findings, the TNM classification is T2N0. According to the AJCC staging system, a T2N0 tumor corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
2,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Primary tumor (pT): The report states that the tumor size is 2.8 cm (greatest dimension), and it is classified as pT1b, which corresponds to a tumor larger than 2 cm but not more than 3 cm in greatest dimension.

2. Regional lymph nodes (pN): The report indicates that 1 out of 17 lymph nodes are involved (pN1). Specifically, 1 lymph node in the peribronchial region of the left lower lobe is positive for malignancy.

3. Distant metastasis (pM): The report states that the distant metastasis status is pMX, which means it cannot be assessed.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* The primary tumor is classified as pT1b, which corresponds to a T1 tumor.
* The regional lymph nodes are classified as pN1, which corresponds to an N1 tumor.
* There is no evidence of distant metastasis.

According to the AJCC staging system, a T1 tumor with N1 nodes corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
3,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (T)**: The maximum tumor size is 2.5 x 2.0 cm, which corresponds to a T1 tumor (≤ 3 cm in greatest dimension).
2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N)**: Ten out of twelve lymph nodes are involved by metastatic carcinoma, including the subcarinal lymph node. This indicates N2 disease (metastases in 4 or more lymph nodes).
3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: There is no evidence of distant metastasis (pMX).

Based on the TNM classification, the patient has a T1 tumor, N2 lymph nodes, and M0 distant metastasis.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T1N2M0 tumor corresponds to **Stage IIIA**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IIIA}"
4,"## Answer

2. Regional lymph nodes (pN): The report states that two lymph nodes were examined, and none were involved, which corresponds to pN0.
3. Distant metastasis (pM): The report does not mention any distant metastasis, which corresponds to pM0.

Based on the TNM classification, the patient's cancer stage is determined by the combination of pT, pN, and pM. In this case, the patient has pT2a, pN0, and pM0, which corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
5,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (pT)**: The report states that the tumor is 2.5 cm in greatest dimension, surrounded by lung or visceral pleura, without bronchoscopic evidence of invasion more proximal than the lobar bronchus. This corresponds to pT1b.
2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN)**: The report indicates that there is no regional lymph node metastasis (pN0).
3. **Distant Metastases (pM)**: There is no mention of distant metastases, so pM0.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage using the TNM staging system.

**Stage**: The combination of pT1b, pN0, and pM0 corresponds to **Stage I**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
6,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the right lower lobe lung and measures 5 x 4 x 3 cm, which corresponds to a T2 tumor (since it's larger than 3 cm but not more than 5 cm).
2. The bronchial margin is negative for tumor, indicating that the tumor has not invaded the bronchus.
3. One of the six intrapulmonary peribronchial lymph nodes is positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma, which indicates N1 disease (metastasis to intrapulmonary lymph nodes).
4. The report does not mention any distant metastases (M1 disease).

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* T2 (primary tumor size)
* N1 (metastasis to intrapulmonary lymph nodes)
* M0 (no distant metastases)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2N1M0 tumor corresponds to Stage IIA.

Therefore, the answer is -

2. The tumor does not invade the visceral pleura, and the surgical margin status is carcinoma extends to within 1 mm of the staple line on this wedge resection.
3. There is no metastatic carcinoma identified in the lymph nodes (0/2, 0/3, and 0/1).
4. The pTN stage is pT1b NO, which indicates that the tumor is 2.3 cm in size and has not spread to the lymph nodes.

Based on the above information, the AJCC stage of the cancer is Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
8,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the right upper lobe, and its size is 3.5 x 2.4 x 2.3 cm. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a tumor of this size corresponds to T2a (tumor >2 cm but ≤3 cm in greatest dimension).
2. The tumor does not grossly appear to involve the bronchus, but it is close to the bronchial margin (0.3 cm). This suggests that the tumor does not invade the bronchus, which is confirmed by the light microscopy examination.
3. The tumor does not invade the pleura, and the distance to the pleura is 0.2 cm.
4. There are two small pleural nodules, one 0.4 cm in diameter and the other 0.4 cm in diameter, which are satellite tumor nodules. These nodules are considered T3a (satellite tumor nodule(s) in the ipsilateral lung lobe).
5. One hilar lymph node (R10) is positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma, which corresponds to N1 (metastasis in ipsilateral peribronchial and/or hilar lymph nodes).
6. There is no evidence of distant metastasis (M0).

Considering the above findings, the AJCC stage of the cancer is:

T2a (primary tumor size) + N1 (metastasis in hilar lymph node) + M0 (no distant metastasis) = Stage IIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IIA}"
9,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions a left lower lobectomy with a tumor measuring 50 x 60 x 45 mm, which involves the posterior lateral basal and anterior basal segments. This indicates a significant tumor size, but no specific T stage is mentioned.

2. The tumor appears to surround a major segmental bronchus and extends close to the bronchial resection margin, but the medial margin is not involved. This suggests that the tumor is likely T2, as it has not invaded the mediastinum or surrounding structures.

3. The report mentions that the tumor probably does not involve the pleura, and this is confirmed by special stains in the addendum report. This rules out any pleural invasion, which would have upgraded the T stage.

4. The report also mentions that there is no vascular or perineural invasion, which is a favorable prognostic factor.

5. The hilar lymph node is negative for metastases, which means the N stage is N0.

6. There is no mention of distant metastases, so the M stage is Mx (unknown).

Based on the above information, the TNM stage is T2N0Mx. According to the AJCC staging system, a T2N0Mx corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
10,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Tumor size**: The tumor size is 3 x 3 x 3 cm, which is a significant factor in determining the T stage. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a tumor of this size corresponds to a T2 stage (tumors > 3 cm in greatest dimension).

2. **Tumor extent**: The tumor extends to the visceral pleura, which indicates a T2 stage as well.

3. **Lymph nodes**: One out of one lymph node is positive for metastasis, which is an N1 stage (metastasis to intrathoracic lymph nodes).

4. **Distant metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so we can assume M0 (no distant metastasis).

Now, let's combine the T, N, and M stages to determine the overall stage. With a T2 stage, N1 stage, and M0 stage, the patient's cancer corresponds to **Stage III** according to the AJCC 8th edition staging system.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
11,"## Answer

1. **Primary tumor (T)**: The report mentions an ""invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma"" in the right lung, measuring 9.2 cm in greatest dimension, invading into the chest wall (pT3).
2. **Lymph node involvement (N)**: The report states that 19 peribronchial lymph nodes are negative for carcinoma (0/19), and 6 lymph nodes from levels 1-9 are also negative (0/6). However, the tumor is classified as N1, indicating ipsilateral hilar and/or peribronchial lymph node involvement (levels 10-14).
3. **Distant metastasis (M)**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so we can assume Mx (unknown) or M0 (no distant metastasis).

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* T3 (primary tumor size > 5 cm and invading into the chest wall)
* N1 (ipsilateral hilar and/or peribronchial lymph node involvement)
* Mx or M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 7th Edition, the stage corresponding to T3N1Mx/M0 is **Stage III**.

19,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor characteristics are:
	* Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma
	* Histologic grade: Poorly differentiated
	* Tumor site: Left upper lobe
	* Tumor focality: Unifocal
	* Tumor size: 4.5 cm
	* Visceral pleural invasion: Present
	* Lymphovascular space invasion: Present
	* Tumor extension: Tumor confined to the lung
2. The lymph node status is:
	* Total number of lymph nodes received: Six (6)
	* Total number of lymph nodes containing metastatic carcinoma: One (1)
	* Extracapsular extension: Present, with invasion of the adjacent artery wall
3. The pTNM stage is reported as pT2aN1MX.

Based on the pTNM stage, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* pT2a: The tumor is 4.5 cm in size, which corresponds to T2a.
* N1: There is metastasis to one lymph node, which corresponds to N1.
* MX: The presence of distant metastases cannot be assessed, but since there is no mention of distant metastases in the report, we can assume M0 (no distant metastases).

20,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor site is the lung, and the histologic type is bronchiolo-alveolar adenocarcinoma, which is a type of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

2. The tumor size is 2.5 X 1.5 X 3 cm, which is a critical factor in determining the T stage. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a tumor size of 2.5 cm or less corresponds to a T1 stage.

3. There is no information about lymph node involvement, lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, or distant metastases, which are essential factors in determining the N and M stages.

4. Given the lack of information about lymph node involvement and distant metastases, we cannot determine the N and M stages.

5. However, based on the tumor size, we can conclude that the T stage is at least T1.

6. Since there is no information to suggest lymph node involvement or distant metastases, the most likely stage is Stage I, which corresponds to a T1 or T2 tumor with no lymph node involvement and no distant metastases.

Therefore, the answer is -

* T1 (tumor size ≤ 3 cm)
* N0 (no lymph node involvement)
* M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T1N0M0 corresponds to **Stage I**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
31,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor site is the upper lobe of the right lung, and the tumor size is 3.7 cm, 2.9 x 2.8 cm, and 1.2 cm x 0.8 cm x 0.7 cm, indicating a T3 tumor (since it's larger than 3 cm).
2. The visceral pleural invasion is not identified, and the tumor extension is not identified, which means there is no invasion into the visceral pleura or other structures.
3. The margins are uninvolved by invasive carcinoma, and the distance of invasive carcinoma from the closest margin is 3.4 cm.
4. Lymph nodes are negative for malignancy (0/11), which means N0.
5. There is no mention of distant metastasis, so M0.

Based on the above information, the AJCC stage is pT3, pNO, and pM0, which corresponds to Stage IIB.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IIB""}"
32,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (PT)**: The report states that the tumor size is 3.5 cm, which corresponds to a T2 tumor (T2: Tumor greater than 3 cm in greatest dimension).
2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (PN)**: The report indicates that there are metastases in ipsilateral peribronchial and ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes, which corresponds to N1 (Metastases in ipsilateral peribronchial and ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes).
3. **Distant Metastasis (MX)**: There is no evidence of distant metastasis (MX).
4. **Margins**: The margins are uninvolved by invasive carcinoma, and the distance of invasive tumor from the closest margin is 5 mm.
5. **Direct Extension of Tumor**: The tumor has extended to the visceral pleura.
6. **Venous (Large Vessel) Invasion (V)**: Present.
7. **Arterial (Large Vessel) Invasion**: Present.
8. **Lymphatic (Small Vessel) Invasion (L)**: Present.

Based on these findings, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* T2 (primary tumor size > 3 cm)
* N1 (metastases in ipsilateral peribronchial and ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes)
* M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC staging system, this corresponds to **Stage III**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
33,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Primary tumor (pT): The primary tumor measures 2.5 cm in greatest dimension, and there is a suggestion of visceral pleural invasion. This corresponds to a pT2a tumor.

2. Regional lymph nodes (pN): The level 12 lymph nodes demonstrate four nodes with evidence of metastasis. This indicates that the cancer has spread to the regional lymph nodes, which corresponds to a pN2 tumor.

3. Distant metastasis (pM): The report states that distant metastasis cannot be evaluated by this specimen, so we cannot determine if there is distant metastasis or not.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage of the cancer. The primary tumor is pT2a, and the regional lymph nodes are pN2. According to the AJCC staging system, this corresponds to Stage IIIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IIIA}"
34,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Primary tumor (pT): The tumor measures 3.5 cm in maximum dimension and invades into the pleura, which corresponds to pT2.

2. Regional lymph nodes (pN): The report states pNX, which means the lymph nodes were not assessed.

3. Distant metastasis (pM): The report states pMX, which means distant metastasis was not assessed.

Based on the information provided, we can determine the T stage as T2 (tumor size > 3 cm and invades the pleura). Since the lymph nodes and distant metastasis were not assessed, we cannot determine the N and M stages.

However, since the tumor invades the pleura, it is likely that the cancer has spread to the pleura, which would correspond to a minimum of Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
35,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions ""Pathologic stage is T2N0MX"". This indicates that the tumor is classified as T2 (tumor size is between 2-5 cm), N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis), and MX (distant metastasis cannot be assessed).

2. The tumor size is 2.8 cm, which falls within the T2 category.

3. There is no regional lymph node metastasis (N0), as all sampled lymph nodes are benign.

4. There is no mention of distant metastasis, so MX is appropriate.

5. The report also mentions angiolymphatic and visceral pleural invasion, which is a feature of the primary tumor and does not affect the N or M classification.

Based on the TNM classification, the patient has a T2N0MX tumor, which corresponds to Stage IIA according to the AJCC 8th edition staging system.

However, since Stage IIA is not an option, we need to consider the closest match. Stage I includes T1 and T2 tumors with N0 and M0, which matches the patient's tumor characteristics.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
36,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor site is in the middle lobe of the right lung, and the maximum tumor size is 5.5 x 5.0 cm, which is a significant size.

2. The histologic type is non-small cell carcinoma, and the grade is G3, poorly differentiated.

3. Visceral pleural invasion is negative, but tumor extension into the fissure is present.

4. The bronchial margin is negative for tumor, and vascular parenchymal parietal pleural margins are all negative for carcinoma.

5. Lymph vascular invasion is indeterminate but favors present.

6. Twelve lymph nodes, including parts A through E, are negative for carcinoma.

7. The pathologic stage is reported as nT2N0M0, which indicates a tumor size greater than 3 cm but not more than 5 cm, no nodal involvement, and no distant metastasis.

Considering the tumor size, extension into the fissure, and lymph vascular invasion, the tumor is likely to be at least Stage II. However, since there is no nodal involvement (N0), it cannot be Stage III. Therefore, the correct stage is Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
37,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the right lung, and its size is 7 cm (mentioned in the final diagnosis of the right lung, pneumonectomy).
2. The tumor has not invaded the visceral pleura (mentioned in the final diagnosis of the right lung, pneumonectomy).
3. The bronchial and vascular margins are negative (mentioned in the final diagnosis of the right lung, pneumonectomy).
4. There is no tumor seen in the lymph nodes of levels 4, 7, and 9 (mentioned in the final diagnosis of the corresponding lymph nodes).
5. However, the tumor has metastasized to the hilar lymph nodes (mentioned in the gross description of the right lung, pneumonectomy).

Based on the above information, we can determine the T, N, and M stages as follows:

* T stage: T2 (tumor size is 7 cm, and there is no invasion of the visceral pleura)
* N stage: N1 (tumor has metastasized to the hilar lymph nodes, but not to the mediastinal lymph nodes)
* M stage: M0 (there is no distant metastasis mentioned in the report)

According to the AJCC staging system, a T2N1M0 corresponds to Stage IIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IIA}"
38,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Primary tumor (pT): The report states that the tumor size is 3.5 cm, which corresponds to pT2a (tumor more than 3 cm but 5 cm or less).

2. Regional lymph nodes (pN): The report mentions that there is metastatic carcinoma in 3 of 18 lymph nodes, which corresponds to pN1 (metastasis in ipsilateral peribronchial lymph nodes).

3. Distant metastasis (pM): There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* pT2a (primary tumor) + pN1 (regional lymph nodes) = Stage IIA or Stage IIIA (depending on the T and N descriptors)

However, since the tumor has metastasized to the ipsilateral peribronchial lymph nodes (pN1), it corresponds to Stage IIIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IIIA}"
