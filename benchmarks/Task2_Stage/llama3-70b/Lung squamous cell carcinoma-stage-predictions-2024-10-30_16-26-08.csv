From the pathology report, we can identify the following key features:

1. The tumor is a squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, with a maximum diameter of 6.3 cm.
2. The tumor invades the visceral pleura and parietal pericardium, but not the chest wall or mediastinum.
3. There is vascular invasion present.
4. The tumor has metastasized to 3 out of 10 lymph nodes (pN1).

According to the AJCC 6th Edition staging system, a tumor with these features would be classified as:

* pT3: The tumor is larger than 5 cm and invades the visceral pleura and parietal pericardium.
* pN1: The tumor has metastasized to 1-3 lymph nodes.
* pMX: The presence of distant metastases cannot be assessed.

Therefore, the overall stage would be Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
1,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions a 1.1 cm moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in the right lung, which has invaded the overlying pleura. This indicates a T2a tumor (since it's ≤2 cm in size and has invaded the pleura).

2. The report also mentions that the margin of resection is negative for carcinoma, which suggests that the tumor has been completely resected.

3. There is no lymphovascular invasion seen, which is a good prognostic factor.

4. The report mentions a benign intrapulmonary lymph node, negative for carcinoma, which suggests that there is no nodal involvement (N0).

5. The patient has a history of left upper lobe carcinoma, which might suggest that this is a metastatic lesion. However, the report does not explicitly state that this is a metastatic lesion.

6. The report also mentions a resected 6th rib, which is negative for carcinoma. This suggests that there is no distant metastasis (M0).

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* T: T2a (tumor ≤2 cm in size and has invaded the pleura)
* N: N0 (no nodal involvement)
* M: M0 (no distant metastasis)

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
2,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor is a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, 27 mm in maximal dimension, located in the right upper lobe.
2. The tumor shows blood vessel and perineural invasion, but no lymphatic permeation is seen.
3. There is no definite pleural invasion identified, and the tumor is clear of the bronchial margin.
4. Hilar lymph node metastases are present, indicating that the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes.

Based on the TNM staging system, we can assign the following values:

* T: The tumor is 27 mm in size, which corresponds to T1 (tumor ≤ 3 cm in greatest dimension).
* N: The presence of hilar lymph node metastases corresponds to N1 (metastasis in ipsilateral peribronchial and/or hilar lymph nodes).
* M: There is no evidence of distant metastases, so M0 (no distant metastasis).

Therefore, the overall stage is T1N1M0, which corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
3,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the left lung, and it measures 4.5 X 3.5 X 2.0cm. The tumor involves the pleura and focally extends to the inked pleural margin.

2. The bronchial margin is negative for tumor, indicating that the tumor has not invaded the bronchus.

3. There is no vascular invasion, as the vascular margin is negative for tumor.

4. The tumor is a Grade II-III squamous carcinoma of the lung.

5. The lymph node status is as follows: 
   - Level 9 node: negative for tumor (0/1)
   - Level 10 nodes: negative for tumor (0/1)
   - Level 5 lymph nodes: negative for tumor (0/3)
   - Level 7 lymph node: negative for tumor (0/1)
   - Hilar lymph nodes: negative for tumor (0/6)

Since the tumor has not invaded the bronchus or blood vessels, and there is no lymph node involvement, the T stage is T2 (tumor > 3cm but ≤ 5cm in greatest dimension).

The N stage is N0, as all lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

Therefore, the overall stage is Stage II (T2N0M0).

The answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
4,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to analyze the pathology report and identify the key features that affect staging.

1. **Primary Tumor (T)**: The tumor size is 3.7 x 2.8 x 2.8 cm, which corresponds to a T2 tumor (tumors > 3 cm but ≤ 5 cm in greatest dimension).
2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N)**: The report shows that one out of ten peribronchial lymph nodes is positive for metastasis (N1: Ipsilateral Hilar and/or Peribronchial). There is no involvement of contralateral mediastinal/hilar, scalene, or supraclavicular lymph nodes (N3).
3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: There is no evidence of distant metastasis (M X).

Based on these findings, the pathological staging (pTNM) is pT2, N1, M X.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a pT2, N1, M X corresponds to **Stage II**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage II}"
5,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor type is squamous cell carcinoma, and the histologic grade is moderately differentiated.
2. The tumor size is 2.4 cm, which corresponds to T1b (tumor 2-3 cm in greatest dimension).
3. The surgical margins are all free of tumor, and there is no direct extension of the tumor.
4. Lymphatic and venous invasions are absent.
5. A total of 7 lymph nodes were examined, and none of them were involved with cancer (pNO).
6. The tumor approaches but does not involve the visceral pleura.

Based on the above information, we can determine the TNM staging as follows:

* T: T1b (tumor 2-3 cm in greatest dimension)
* N: N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis)
* M: MX (distant metastasis cannot be assessed)

According to the AJCC staging system, a T1bN0MX corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
6,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor (pT) is classified as pT2a, which means the tumor is > 3 cm and < 5 cm in greatest dimension, surrounded by lung or visceral pleura, without bronchoscopic evidence of invasion in the main bronchus.
2. The regional lymph nodes (pN) are classified as pNO, which means there is no regional lymph node metastasis.
3. There is no mention of distant metastasis (pM), so it is not applicable.

According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a pT2a classification and pNO lymph nodes would correspond to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
7,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumour size is 45 mm in diameter, which corresponds to T2a (tumour > 3 cm but ≤ 5 cm).
2. There is no pleural invasion, lymphatic invasion, vascular invasion, or perineural invasion.
3. The tumour is clear of the bronchial resection margin, with only focal mild and moderate squamous dysplasia at the margin.
4. The peribronchial lymph nodes, left hilar lymph node, and mediastinal lymph node are not involved by tumour, indicating N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis).

Based on these findings, the pathological stage is pT2a NO. According to the AJCC staging system, a T2a tumour with no nodal involvement (N0) corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
8,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions a primary tumor in the right lower lobe of the lung, measuring 5 x 4.5 x 2.6 cm, which is a significant size. However, it does not extend through the pleura, which suggests that the tumor is still localized within the lung.

2. The bronchial margin is negative for tumor, indicating that the tumor has not invaded the bronchus.

3. Multiple intrapulmonary peribronchial lymph nodes (6) are negative for tumor, which suggests that the tumor has not spread to these lymph nodes.

4. The report also mentions that multiple superior and inferior mediastinal lymph nodes (a total of 11) and N1 lymph nodes (3) are negative for tumor. This indicates that the tumor has not spread to the regional lymph nodes.

Based on these findings, we can conclude that the tumor is localized to the right lower lobe of the lung, has not invaded the pleura or bronchus, and has not spread to the regional lymph nodes.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
9,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The patient has a squamous cell carcinoma of the left upper lobe, poorly differentiated, with a tumor size of 3.2 cm (T2).
2. There is no vascular invasion or perineural invasion.
3. The tumor involves the visceral pleura (PL1).
4. The bronchial margin is free of tumor.
5. There are no metastatic lymph nodes in the peribronchial, hilar, or mediastinal lymph nodes (N0).
6. The tumor is located in the left upper lobe, and there is no evidence of distant metastases (M0).

Based on the TNM staging system, the patient has a T2N0M0 tumor. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, this corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
10,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Primary tumor (pT): The report states that the primary tumor is pT1b, which means the tumor is 2 cm or less in size and has not invaded the visceral pleura.

2. Regional lymph nodes (pN): The report states that the regional lymph nodes are pNO, which means there is no evidence of tumor in the lymph nodes.

3. Distant metastasis (pM): The report states that distant metastasis is not applicable, which means there is no evidence of distant metastasis.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

Since the primary tumor is pT1b and there is no evidence of regional lymph node involvement (pNO) or distant metastasis, the AJCC stage of the cancer is Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
11,"## Answer

The patient's pathology report indicates a primary lung tumor with the following characteristics:

* Tumor location: Right upper lobe
* Tumor size: 4.5 cm (maximum dimension) and 3.5 cm (minor dimension)
* Gross satellites: 1
* Tumor type: Invasive squamous carcinoma
* Histologic grade: Moderately differentiated (G2)
* Extrapulmonary parenchymal extension/invasion of tumor: Visceral pleura
* Angiolymphatic invasion: Present
* Tumor necrosis: > 50%
* Surgical margin involvement: No
* N1 lymph nodes: 1 out of 12 positive
* N2 lymph nodes: 0 out of 4 positive
* M stage: pMX (cannot be assessed)

Based on the AJCC staging system, the patient's tumor is classified as:

* T stage: pT4 (due to visceral pleural invasion)
* N stage: pN1 (due to 1 positive N1 lymph node out of 12)
* M stage: pMX (cannot be assessed)

Therefore, the patient's AJCC stage is Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
12,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report describes a lung wedge excision with a 2.3 x 2 x 1.8 cm mass abutting but not directly invading the pleura. This suggests that the tumor is confined to the lung and has not invaded the pleura, which is a key factor in determining the T stage.

2. The T stage is determined by the size of the tumor and its invasion of surrounding structures. Based on the report, the tumor is 2.3 cm in size, which corresponds to a T1 stage (tumors ≤ 3 cm in size).

3. The report also mentions that multiple lymph nodes were excised, including inferior mediastinal, aortic, and N1 lymph nodes. However, all of these lymph nodes were negative for tumor, indicating that there is no nodal involvement. This corresponds to an N0 stage.

4. Since there is no mention of distant metastases in the report, the M stage is M0.

5. Combining the T, N, and M stages, we get a stage of T1N0M0, which corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
13,"## Answer

From the pathology report, we can see that the patient has a keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma in the left lung, with a tumor size of 2.5 cm (pT2). The pleura, bronchial, and vascular margins are negative for tumor. There is no involvement of the peribronchial lymph nodes (pN0).

According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a size of 2.5 cm, without lymph node involvement, and without distant metastases, corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
14,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions the tumor size as 4.2999999999999998 cm, which is not a critical factor in determining the stage in this case.
2. The histology is Squamous carcinoma, and the grade/differentiation is III, which indicates a moderately to poorly differentiated tumor. However, this information is not directly related to the staging.
3. The Pathological T (pT) stage is T2a, which means the tumor is larger than 3 cm but not larger than 5 cm, and it has not invaded the main bronchus or the visceral pleura.
4. The Pathological N (pN) stage is N1, indicating that the cancer has spread to the ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes, and/or intrapulmonary nodes involved by direct extension of the primary tumor.
5. The Clinical M (cM) stage is M0, indicating that there is no distant metastasis.

Based on the AJCC staging system, a T2a tumor with N1 nodes and M0 distant metastasis corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
15,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor size is 3 X 3 X 3.5 cm, which is a significant factor in determining the T stage (primary tumor size). According to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual, a tumor size of 3-4 cm corresponds to a T1b stage.

2. There is no information about the involvement of lymph nodes (N stage) or distant metastases (M stage) in the report. This lack of information makes it difficult to determine the N and M stages.

3. Since the tumor size is known, and there is no information about lymph node involvement or distant metastases, we can only determine the T stage (T1b) and not the overall stage.

4. Considering the available information, the most likely answer choice would be the one that corresponds to a T1b stage. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual, a T1b stage corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
16,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (T)**: The tumor size is 4.2 x 4.0 x 2.3 cm, and it invades the visceral pleura. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual, this corresponds to a T2a tumor (tumor > 3 cm but ≤ 5 cm in greatest dimension, or tumor with visceral pleural invasion).

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N)**: Only one peribronchial lymph node was received, and it did not contain metastatic carcinoma. Therefore, the nodal status is NO (no regional lymph node metastases).

3. **Distant Metastases (M)**: There is no mention of distant metastases in the pathology report.

Based on the above information, the pTNM stage is pT2a NO, which corresponds to **Stage II** according to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
17,"## Answer

The patient's pathology report indicates a pathologic stage of T2 N1 MX. 

The T stage is T2, which corresponds to a tumor size of 5.0 cm, but without visceral pleural invasion. 

The N stage is N1, which indicates metastasis to one of twelve N1 lymph nodes. 

The M stage is MX, which means that distant metastases cannot be assessed. 

According to the AJCC staging system, a T2 N1 MX corresponds to Stage IIA. 

However, since the options provided do not include Stage IIA, we need to consider the closest match. 

Stage II includes T1-2 N1 M0, which is similar to the patient's stage, except for the M stage. 

Since the M stage is MX, which is unknown, we cannot rule out the possibility of distant metastases. 

However, based on the available information, the closest match is Stage II. 

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
18,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions ""Squamous cell carcinoma"" as the histological description, which indicates the type of cancer.
2. The TNM Stage is provided as T2, N0, M0.
   - T2 indicates the tumor is larger than 3 cm but not larger than 5 cm, or it's a tumor that's 5 cm or smaller and has grown into the bronchus, but not into the main bronchus near the carina.
   - N0 indicates there is no regional lymph node metastasis.
   - M0 indicates there is no distant metastasis.

Based on the TNM Stage, we can determine the overall stage of the cancer.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2, N0, M0 corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
19,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor size is 57 mm in greatest dimension, which corresponds to T3 (tumor > 5 cm in greatest dimension).
2. The tumor invades the pericardium, but does not extend through to the inner mesothelial-lined surface, which is still considered T3.
3. There is no evidence of pleural invasion on the opposite aspect of the specimen to the adherent pericardium.
4. Vascular, lymphatic, and perineural invasion are present, but this does not affect the T stage.
5. The bronchial resection margin is clear of malignancy, and there is no evidence of lymph node metastases (NO).

Based on the above findings, the pathological stage is T3 NO. Since there is no evidence of distant metastases (M0), the overall stage is determined by the T and N stages.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
20,"## Answer

From the pathology report, we can identify the key features of the cancer:

1. The tumor is a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma located in the apical segment of the right lower lobe, measuring 52 mm in diameter.
2. The tumor invades the parietal pleura, but the soft tissue resection margin is clear of malignancy.
3. There is extensive vascular invasion present.
4. Focal perineural invasion is present.
5. No lymphatic invasion is found.
6. Metastatic carcinoma is present in the No. 11 lymph node (N1).

Based on these features, we can determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

The primary tumor (T) is classified as T3 due to the tumor size (>5 cm) and invasion of the parietal pleura.

The lymph node involvement (N) is classified as N1 due to the presence of metastatic carcinoma in the No. 11 lymph node.

There is no evidence of distant metastasis (M), so M0.

Therefore, the AJCC stage of the cancer is Stage III (T3 N1 M0).

Therefore, the answer is -

2. There is no evidence of visceral pleural or angiolymphatic invasion.
3. One of the 15 N1 lymph nodes is positive for metastases, which corresponds to an N1 lymph node status (N1: metastasis in ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes).
4. There is no evidence of metastases in the N2 lymph nodes.
5. There is no evidence of distant metastases (M0).

Based on the TNM classification, the patient's cancer stage is T2N1M0, which corresponds to Stage IIA according to the AJCC 8th edition staging system.

23,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor (T) is described as a moderately differentiated keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma, 11.0 cm in size, with negative visceral pleural, bronchial, and vascular margins. This corresponds to a pT2 tumor, which is a tumor larger than 5 cm but not more than 7 cm in greatest dimension.

2. The lymph node status (N) is described as N1, which means there is metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes, and/or intrapulmonary nodes, including involvement by direct extension.

3. There is no mention of distant metastasis (M) in the report.

According to the AJCC staging system, a pT2 tumor with N1 lymph node status corresponds to Stage IIA.

However, the report also mentions that one of the lymph nodes (Level 10 lymph node) is positive for microscopic metastatic carcinoma, which suggests that the tumor has spread to mediastinal lymph nodes. This would upgrade the N status to N2, which corresponds to Stage IIIA.

Therefore, the answer is -

24,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer:

1. Tumor size: 3 X 2 X 2 cm - This information is not sufficient to determine the T stage, as we need to know the exact size and location of the tumor.
2. Histologic type: Squamous cell carcinoma - This information is not relevant for staging.
3. Histologic grade: Poorly differentiated - This information is not relevant for staging.
4. Tumor extent: Not specified - This information is not available, but we can infer that the tumor is at least T2 (since it's 3 cm in size) based on the AJCC 8th edition staging manual.
5. Lymph nodes: 3/6 positive for metastasis (Intrathoracical 3/6) - This indicates that there is N2 disease, as there are metastases in intrathoracic lymph nodes.

Based on the available information, we can determine the stage as follows:

* T stage: At least T2 (based on tumor size)
* N stage: N2 (based on lymph node metastases)
* M stage: Not specified, but there is no indication of distant metastases.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual, a T2N2M0 tumor corresponds to Stage IIIA.

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Tumor size: 8 x 8 x 8 cm - This is a large tumor, but tumor size alone does not determine the stage.
2. Tumor extent: Visceral pleura - This indicates that the tumor has invaded the visceral pleura, which is a key factor in determining the T descriptor. According to the AJCC 8th edition, this corresponds to a T3 descriptor.
3. Lymph nodes: 8/10 positive for metastasis (Intrathoracical 8/10) - This indicates that there is lymph node involvement, specifically in the intrathoracic lymph nodes. This corresponds to an N2 descriptor.
4. No evidence of distant metastasis (M descriptor) is mentioned in the report.

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the Cancer.

1. The report does not provide explicit information about the tumor size (T), lymph node involvement (N), or distant metastasis (M), which are essential components for determining the AJCC Stage.

2. The report focuses on administrative and logistical information, such as the tumor type, BCR location, date specimen received, ICD-0-3 Histology Code, and ICD-0-3 Site Code. These details do not provide direct clues about the stage of the cancer.

3. Without specific information about the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis, it is challenging to determine the AJCC Stage accurately.

4. Given the lack of relevant information, it is not possible to confidently assign a specific stage (I, II, III, or IV) to the cancer.

27,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor is a squamous cell carcinoma, moderately differentiated, with a maximal tumor size of 7.7 cm. This corresponds to a T2 tumor, as it is greater than 3 cm in greatest dimension.

2. The visceral pleura is invaded, which is also consistent with a T2 tumor.

3. There is no regional lymph node metastasis, as all peribronchial lymph nodes (6 lobar and 1 segmental) are negative for malignancy. This corresponds to an N0 tumor.

4. The surgical resection margins are negative for malignancy, and the distance of invasive carcinoma from the closest margin is 3.5 cm.

5. There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report.

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer:

1. The primary tumor is a 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm mass located 1.8 cm away from the bronchial margin, which is negative for tumor. This suggests that the tumor is confined to the lung and has not invaded the bronchial margin.

2. The report mentions that multiple (10) intrapulmonary peribronchial lymph nodes are negative for tumor. This indicates that the tumor has not spread to the intrapulmonary lymph nodes.

3. The report also mentions that the visceral pleura is negative for tumor. This suggests that the tumor has not invaded the visceral pleura.

4. The report mentions that the soft tissue, left hilar region, excision shows Grade 4 non-small cell carcinoma with squamous features. This suggests that the tumor has spread to the hilar region, which is a regional lymph node station.

5. The report mentions that multiple lymph nodes from the superior mediastinal, aortic, inferior mediastinal, and left lower lobe bronchus are negative for tumor. This suggests that the tumor has not spread to these lymph node stations.

Based on the above findings, we can determine the T, N, and M stages as follows:

* T stage: The primary tumor is 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm in size and has not invaded the bronchial margin or visceral pleura. Therefore, the T stage is T2a (tumor 2-3 cm in greatest dimension).
* N stage: The tumor has spread to the hilar region (N1), but not to the mediastinal or other lymph node stations.
* M stage: There is no evidence of distant metastasis.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2a, N1, M0 tumor corresponds to Stage IIIA.

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor (T) is described as a 4.5 cm poorly differentiated basaloid type squamous cell carcinoma that invades the visceral pleura but not the pericardium. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual, this corresponds to a T2 tumor, as it is larger than 3 cm but not larger than 5 cm, and invades the visceral pleura.

2. The regional lymph nodes (N) are described as pNO, meaning no lymph nodes are involved by tumor. This corresponds to an N0 designation.

3. The metastasis (M) is not mentioned in the report, and there is no evidence of distant metastases. Therefore, the M designation is MX, meaning the presence of distant metastases cannot be assessed.

3. There is no information about tumor extent, lymph nodes, lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, or margins, which are crucial factors in determining the stage.
4. Since there is no information about lymph node involvement or distant metastases, we cannot determine if the cancer has spread beyond the primary tumor site.

Given the limited information, we can only conclude that the tumor is localized to the lung, and there is no evidence of lymph node involvement or distant metastases. Therefore, the most likely stage is Stage I, as it is the earliest stage of lung cancer, characterized by a tumor that is localized to the lung and has not spread to lymph nodes or distant sites.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
32,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor is located in the left lower lobe (LLL) of the lung, and the greatest dimension is 4.0 cm. This corresponds to a pT2 tumor, as it is greater than 3 cm in greatest dimension.

2. The lymph node status is pN1, as there is metastasis in one of the nine lymph nodes in the left lobar region (12L).

3. There is no evidence of distant metastasis (pMX: Cannot be assessed).

4. The tumor has invaded small venous vessels (venous invasion present), but there is no evidence of pleural invasion or direct extension of the tumor.

Based on the pT2 and pN1 classifications, the AJCC stage of the cancer is Stage IIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IIA""}"
33,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the primary tumor (pT), regional lymph nodes (pN), and distant metastasis (pM).

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The primary tumor (pT) is classified as pT2a, which means the tumor is > 3 cm and < 5 cm in greatest dimension, surrounded by lung or visceral pleura, without bronchoscopic evidence of invasion in the main bronchus.
* The regional lymph nodes (pN) are classified as pNO, which means there is no regional lymph node metastasis.
* There is no mention of distant metastasis (pM), so we can assume it is not applicable.

Based on the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a pT2a classification and pNO lymph nodes would correspond to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
34,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary tumor (pT)**: The tumor measures 5.5 cm in dimension and extends through the pleura but is not identified at the outer surface of the specimen. This corresponds to a T2b tumor, as it is larger than 4 cm but does not invade the visceral pleura.
2. **Margins of resection**: The margins are negative for tumor, which is a good prognostic factor.
3. **Direct extension of tumor**: The tumor extends into the pleura, which shows a desmoplastic response to tumor, but is not identified at the outer surface of the specimen.
4. **Vessel invasion**: Not identified.
5. **Regional lymph nodes (pN)**: pNO, meaning no regional lymph node metastases are identified.
6. **Distant metastasis (pM)**: pMx, meaning distant metastases cannot be assessed.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* T2b (primary tumor size and extension)
* N0 (no regional lymph node metastases)
* Mx (distant metastases cannot be assessed)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2bN0Mx tumor corresponds to **Stage II**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
35,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to analyze the pathology report and identify the key factors that influence staging.

From the report, we can see that the tumor is a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma located in the right upper lobe of the lung. The tumor size is 4.9 x 4.7 x 4.5 cm, which corresponds to a T3 tumor (T3: tumor > 5 cm or invading the chest wall).

The report also states that the tumor invades less than 0.1 cm from the superior chest wall soft tissue surgical margin, which indicates that the tumor has invaded the chest wall (PL3). This is a key factor in determining the stage.

The lymph node status is negative for carcinoma (pNO), which means that there is no lymph node involvement.

Based on these factors, we can determine the stage as follows:

* T3: tumor > 5 cm or invading the chest wall
* N0: no lymph node involvement
* M0: no distant metastases (not mentioned in the report, but assumed to be M0 since there is no mention of metastases)
* PL3: tumor invades the chest wall

According to the AJCC staging system, a T3N0M0 tumor with PL3 invasion corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
36,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the Cancer:

1. The primary tumor (T) is described as a 4.5 x 4 x 3 cm intrabronchial and parenchymal hilar mass, which is a significant size. However, there is no mention of invasion into the pleura or chest wall, so it's likely a T2 or T3.

2. The bronchial margin is involved by extensive in situ carcinoma, but this does not affect the T stage.

3. The lymph nodes (N) are involved by metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in multiple stations, including intrapulmonary peribronchial (6 of 14), aortopulmonary (2 of 2), and anterior mediastinal (1 of 2) lymph nodes. This indicates a significant nodal involvement, likely N3.

4. There is no mention of distant metastases (M) in the report.

Based on the above analysis, the tumor is likely T2 or T3, N3, and M0. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, this corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
37,"## Answer

From the pathology report, we can identify the following key features:

1. The tumor is a poorly differentiated large cell carcinoma with squamoid features, measuring 3.5 cm in greatest dimension.
2. The tumor is predominantly endobronchial, but with pulmonary parenchymal invasion.
3. The closest inked pleural margin is negative for malignancy.
4. The bronchus and blood vessels at the surgical margin are negative for malignancy, and there is no lymphovascular invasion.
5. No hilar lymph nodes are identified with malignancy.

Based on these features, we can determine the T stage as T2a (tumor 3.5 cm in greatest dimension, with pulmonary parenchymal invasion, but not involving the visceral pleura).

Since there is no lymph node involvement (N0), the N stage is N0.

The M stage is M0, as there is no evidence of distant metastasis.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2a, N0, M0 corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
38,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The patient has a moderately to poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the right lower lobe lung, measuring 2.9 x 2.5 x 1.8 cm.
2. The tumor extends subpleurally but not to the pleural surface, and the bronchial margin is free of tumor.
3. There is no vascular invasion or perineural invasion identified.
4. The lymph node status is as follows: all lymph nodes examined (Level VII mediastinal, Level VII mediastinal #2, and Right mediastinal lymph node level XI) are benign, with no metastatic nodes identified.

Based on the above information, we can determine the T, N, and M stages as follows:

* T stage: T2 (tumor size is 2.9 cm, and it extends subpleurally but not to the pleural surface)
* N stage: N0 (no metastatic nodes identified in any of the lymph nodes examined)
* M stage: M0 (no distant metastases identified)

According to the AJCC staging system, a T2N0M0 corresponds to Stage I.

39,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary diagnosis is a large, intermediate to peripheral bronchopulmonary, histologically poorly differentiated, large-cell and polymorphocellular nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma of the right lower lobe of the lung.
2. The TNM classification is provided as pT2 pNO pMX R0, which indicates:
   - pT2: The primary tumor is larger than 3 cm but not larger than 5 cm, or it is a tumor that is larger than 5 cm but not larger than 7 cm, and it has not invaded the visceral pleura (T2).
   - pNO: There is no regional lymph node metastasis (N0).
   - pMX: The presence of distant metastasis cannot be assessed (MX).
   - R0: The surgical margins are free of tumor (R0).
3. Based on the TNM classification, the stage is IB.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IB""}"
40,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to analyze the pathology report and identify the key features that affect staging.

From the report, we can see that:

1. The tumor is a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with multiple nodules in the same lobe (upper lobe).
2. The tumor size is 5.5 cm x 4.0 cm x 3.5 cm.
3. There is no pleural or lymphovascular invasion.
4. The bronchial and vascular margins of resection are negative for carcinoma.
5. There are separate tumor nodules in the same lobe, which is a key feature for staging.
6. All lymph nodes examined (8 nodes) are negative for metastatic carcinoma.

Based on these features, we can determine the TNM descriptors as follows:

* Primary Tumor (pT): pT3 (due to the separate tumor nodule in the same lobe)
* Regional Lymph Nodes (pN): pN0 (no regional lymph node metastasis)
* Distant Metastasis (pM): pM0 (not applicable, as there is no evidence of distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC staging system, a pT3 tumor with pN0 lymph nodes and pM0 distant metastasis corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
41,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Tumor size**: The tumor size is 6.5 x 5.5 x 5.5 cm, which is a significant size. However, the AJCC staging system for lung cancer does not solely rely on tumor size.

2. **Tumor extent**: The tumor extent is not specified, which means we cannot determine if the tumor has invaded nearby structures or not.

3. **Lymph nodes**: 0/6 lymph nodes are positive for metastasis, indicating that there is no lymph node involvement.

4. **Distant metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report.

Based on the available information, we can conclude that the tumor is relatively large, but there is no lymph node involvement or distant metastasis.

According to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer, a tumor of this size (T2 or T3) with no lymph node involvement (N0) and no distant metastasis (M0) would correspond to **Stage II**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
42,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size (T), lymph node involvement (N), and distant metastasis (M).

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The tumor size is 4.5 cm (pT3), which is a significant factor in determining the stage.
* There is no lymph node involvement (NO), as all lymph nodes examined were negative for malignancy.
* There is no distant metastasis (Mx), as the report does not mention any metastases to other organs or tissues.

Based on the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a size of 4.5 cm (T3) and no lymph node involvement (N0) would correspond to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
43,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor type is squamous cell carcinoma, which is a type of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
2. The tumor size is 2x2x1.8cm, which corresponds to a T1 tumor (≤3 cm in greatest dimension).
3. The bronchial margin is negative, indicating that the tumor does not involve the main stem bronchus.
4. The visceral pleural margin is also negative, indicating that the tumor does not invade the visceral pleura.
5. There is no angiolymphatic invasion or perineural invasion.
6. The hilar lymph nodes (peribronchial) are negative (0/2), indicating that there is no nodal involvement (N0).

Based on these findings, the pathologic stage is pT1N0, which corresponds to Stage I according to the AJCC 8th edition staging system.

46,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The tumor size is 5.0 cm, which corresponds to T2a (tumor > 3 cm but ≤ 5 cm).
* The tumor has invaded the mainstem bronchus and has perineural invasion, but the bronchial margin is free of tumor.
* There is metastatic carcinoma in regional lymph nodes, with 6/9 peribronchial lymph nodes and 1/1 parenchymal lymph node involved.
* There is no evidence of distant metastasis.

Based on the TNM staging system, the tumor is classified as:

* T2a (tumor size > 3 cm but ≤ 5 cm)
* N2 (metastasis in ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes)
* M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, the stage corresponding to T2a, N2, and M0 is Stage IIIA.

48,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor type is squamous cell carcinoma, and the histologic grade is poorly differentiated.
2. The tumor size is 1.8 cm, which is a key factor in determining the T stage.
3. The surgical margins are all free of tumor, and there is no direct extension of the tumor.
4. Lymphatic and venous invasions are absent.
5. A total of 6 lymph nodes were examined, and none of them were involved with cancer (0/6).
6. The TNM staging is reported as pT1a, pNO, pMX.

Based on the TNM staging, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* pT1a indicates a tumor size ≤ 2 cm, which corresponds to T1a.
* pNO indicates no regional lymph node metastasis, which corresponds to N0.
* pMX indicates that distant metastasis cannot be assessed, but since there is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, we can assume M0.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T1a, N0, M0 corresponds to Stage I.

{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
49,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer:

1. The report mentions ""THE CARCINOMA INVOLVES THE PLEURAL SURFACE"", which indicates that the tumor has invaded the visceral pleura (T2).
2. The report states that ""ALL OTHER SURGICAL MARGINS OF RESECTION ARE NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR"", which means that the tumor has not invaded the surgical margins (R0 resection).
3. The report mentions that ""ONE (1) HILAR LYMPH NODE AND ASSOCIATED FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR"", which indicates that the hilar lymph node is negative for tumor (N0).
4. The report also mentions that two other lymph nodes (Station 5 and L11) are negative for tumor, which further supports the N0 status.

Based on the above findings, we can determine the TNM stage as follows:

* T: T2 (tumor invades the visceral pleura)
* N: N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis)
* M: M0 (no distant metastasis, not mentioned in the report)

According to the AJCC staging system, a T2N0M0 corresponds to Stage II.

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions a poorly-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma in the left upper lobe of the lung, with a maximal dimension of 37mm.
2. There is no evidence of pleural invasion, blood vessel invasion, lymphatic permeation, or perineural permeation.
3. The tumor is at least 25mm deep to the closest pleural surface and at least 30mm from the bronchial resection margin.
4. The peribronchial lymph nodes show sinus histiocytosis and contain carbon pigment, but no metastases are present.
5. The summary section of the report states the pathological stage as T2N0Mx.

Based on the AJCC staging system, a T2 tumor is defined as a tumor larger than 3cm but not larger than 5cm in greatest dimension. Since the tumor is 37mm in maximal dimension, it falls within the T2 category.

The N0 designation indicates that there are no regional lymph node metastases, which is consistent with the report's finding of no metastases in the peribronchial lymph nodes.

The Mx designation indicates that distant metastases cannot be assessed.

Therefore, the overall stage of the cancer is Stage II, which corresponds to a T2N0Mx designation.

Therefore, the answer is -

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor size is 4 X 3 X 3.5 cm, which is a significant size, but we need to consider other factors to determine the stage.
2. The histologic type is squamous cell carcinoma, which is a type of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
3. The histologic grade is moderately differentiated, which does not directly impact the staging.
4. There is no information about tumor extent, other tumor nodules, lymph nodes, lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, or margins, which are crucial factors in determining the stage.
5. Since there is no information about lymph node involvement or distant metastases, we cannot determine if the cancer has spread beyond the lung.

Based on the available information, the tumor size is the only factor that can be used to determine the stage. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a tumor size of 4 cm or larger is classified as T2a. Since there is no information about lymph node involvement or distant metastases, the stage cannot be determined more specifically.

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor (T) is described as a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, 28 mm in maximal dimension, with an endobronchial component. The tumor appears to directly invade a peribronchial lymph node. There is no evidence of blood vessel, lymphatic, or perineural invasion. Based on this, the T stage is T2 (tumor > 2 cm but ≤ 5 cm in greatest dimension).

2. The lymph nodes (N) are described as follows: 
   - The lymph node adjacent to the tumor appears to be involved (N1).
   - Multiple lymph nodes (2-9) are examined, and only one lymph node (specimen 8) shows squamous cell carcinoma, which is surrounded by a dense fibrous capsule, indicating a hilar lymph node metastasis (N1).

3. There is no evidence of distant metastases (M0).

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor is located in the right lower lobe of the lung, and it's a squamous cell carcinoma.
2. The tumor size is 3.0 X 3.0 X 3.0 cm, which corresponds to a T1b tumor (since it's ≤ 4 cm in greatest dimension).
3. However, the report mentions a ""satellite tumor"" which upgrades the tumor stage to T3.
4. There is no visceral pleural invasion, and the tumor appears confined to the lung.
5. Lymphovascular space invasion is suspected, but not confirmed.
6. The tumor distance from the bronchial margin is 2.0 cm, and from the pleural surface is less than 0.1 cm.
7. No lymph nodes contain metastatic carcinoma (0/2).
