To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to analyze the pathology report and identify the key factors that influence staging.

From the report, we can see that the patient has two separate primary tumors: one in the lingula (1 cm) and another in the left lower lobe (3.5 cm). Both tumors are adenocarcinomas with different histological subtypes.

The tumor in the lingula is classified as pT1a (≤ 1 cm), and the tumor in the left lower lobe is classified as pT2a (3.5 cm, but ≤ 5 cm). Since there are two separate primary tumors, we need to consider the m descriptor, which indicates multiple primary tumors.

The report also indicates that there is no regional lymph node metastasis (pN0) and no distant metastases (pM0).

Based on the TNM descriptors, we can determine the overall stage of the cancer. Since both tumors are classified as pT1a and pT2a, respectively, and there is no lymph node involvement or distant metastases, the overall stage is Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage II}"
1,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor characteristics are:
	* Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated
	* Tumor location: Subpleural right lower lung lobe
	* Tumor size: 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.6 cm
	* Tumor grade: Moderately differentiated
2. The tumor invasiveness is:
	* Pleural invasion: Yes (tumor appears to focally involve overlying pleura)
	* Lymphovascular space invasion: No
3. The surgical margin status is:
	* Tumor distance from bronchial margin: 2.8 cm
	* Tumor distance from stapled margin: Not applicable
	* Tumor distance from pleural surface: Less than 0.5 cm, focally involving pleura microscopically
4. The lymph node status is:
	* All lymph nodes (R, L, Station 11, Station 12, and Station 7) are negative for tumor

Based on the above information, we can determine the T, N, and M stages:

* T stage: T2 (tumor size is 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.6 cm, and there is pleural invasion)
* N stage: N0 (all lymph nodes are negative for tumor)
* M stage: M0 (not mentioned in the report, but assumed to be M0 since there is no evidence of distant metastasis)

Therefore, the AJCC stage is T2N0M0, which corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
2,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Primary tumor (pT): The report states pT1b, which means the tumor is 2.8 cm in greatest dimension, and it has not invaded the visceral pleura or extended beyond the lung.

2. Regional lymph nodes (pN): The report states pN1, which means there is metastasis to one or more ipsilateral peribronchial or hilar lymph nodes, but not to ipsilateral mediastinal or subcarinal lymph nodes.

3. Distant metastasis (pM): The report states pMX, which means distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Based on the pT1b and pN1 classifications, the patient has a Stage II cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
3,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The maximum tumor size is 2.5 x 2.0 cm, which corresponds to a T1 tumor (pT1).
* Ten out of twelve lymph nodes are involved by metastatic carcinoma, including the subcarinal lymph node. This indicates N2 disease (pN2).
* There is no distant metastasis (pMX).
* The margins are all negative, but the tumor approaches to within less than 1 mm of the inked hilar pleural surface.
* There is extensive lymphvascular invasion in the lung, including subpleural lymphatics.

Based on these findings, the tumor is classified as T1N2M0, which corresponds to Stage IIIA according to the AJCC 8th edition staging system.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IIIA""}"
4,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Primary tumor (pT): The report states that the tumor measures 2.7 cm in greatest dimension and invades the visceral pleura, which corresponds to a pT2a.
2. Regional lymph nodes (pN): The report states that two lymph nodes were examined, and none were involved, which corresponds to a pN0.
3. Distant metastasis (pM): The report does not mention any distant metastasis, so it is assumed to be pM0.

According to the AJCC 7th edition staging system, a pT2a primary tumor, pN0 regional lymph nodes, and pM0 distant metastasis correspond to a Stage II cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
5,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Primary Tumor (pT): The report states that the tumor is 2.5 cm in greatest dimension, surrounded by lung or visceral pleura, without bronchoscopic evidence of invasion more proximal than the lobar bronchus. This corresponds to pT1b.

2. Regional Lymph Nodes (pN): The report indicates that there is no regional lymph node metastasis, which corresponds to pN0.

3. Distant Metastases (pM): There is no mention of distant metastases, so pM is not applicable.

Based on the pT and pN classifications, the AJCC stage is determined as follows:

* pT1b and pN0 correspond to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
6,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the right lower lobe lung and measures 5 x 4 x 3 cm, which corresponds to a T2 tumor (T1: ≤3 cm, T2: >3 cm but ≤5 cm, T3: >5 cm but ≤7 cm, T4: >7 cm).
2. The bronchial margin is negative for tumor, indicating that the tumor has not invaded the bronchus.
3. One of the six intrapulmonary peribronchial lymph nodes is positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma, which corresponds to N1 disease (N1: metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial and/or hilar lymph nodes).
4. The report does not mention any distant metastases (M1).

Based on the TNM classification, the patient has a T2N1M0 tumor. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2N1M0 tumor corresponds to Stage IIA.

However, the options provided do not include Stage IIA. The closest match is Stage II, which includes T2N1M0 tumors.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
7,"## Answer

1. The tumor size is 2.3 cm in greatest diameter, which corresponds to T1b (tumor size > 2 cm but ≤ 3 cm).
2. The visceral pleural invasion is present, but the carcinoma does not extend through the visceral pleura.
3. Lymphovascular space invasion is highly suspicious, but not definitively confirmed.
4. The surgical margin status shows that the carcinoma extends to within 1 mm of the staple line on the wedge resection.
5. No metastatic carcinoma is identified in the lymph nodes (0/2 in level 7, 0/3 in right lung lower lobe, 0/1 in level 9, and 0/1 in level 4).

Based on these findings, the pTN stage is pT1b NO, which corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
8,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor is located in the right upper lobe, and its size is 3.5 x 2.4 x 2.3 cm.
2. The tumor does not grossly involve the bronchus, but it appears to be growing around the bronchus. The distance to the bronchial margin is 0.3 cm.
3. There are two small pleural nodules, one 0.4 cm in diameter and 5.2 cm from the main tumor mass, and another 0.4 cm in diameter and 3.1 cm from the main tumor mass.
4. The tumor is moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, and the histologic grade is moderately differentiated.
5. One of the five hilar lymph nodes is positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma.
6. The surgical margins, including the bronchial resection margin, appear negative for carcinoma.
7. There is no pleural involvement, and no in situ carcinoma is identified.
8. Perineural invasion is present, but angiolymphatic invasion is not identified.

Based on the above findings, we can determine the T, N, and M stages as follows:

* T stage: T2a (tumor size is 3.5 cm, and it does not invade the bronchus)
* N stage: N1 (metastatic adenocarcinoma involving one of the five hilar lymph nodes)
* M stage: M0 (no distant metastases are identified)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2a, N1, M0 corresponds to Stage IIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IIA}"
9,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions a left lower lobectomy with a tumor measuring 50 x 60 x 45 mm, which involves the posterior lateral basal and anterior basal segments. This suggests a significant tumor size, but no specific T stage is mentioned.

2. The tumor appears to surround a major segmental bronchus and extends close to the bronchial resection margin, but the medial margin is not involved. This implies that the tumor is likely to be T2, as it has not invaded the mediastinum or other structures.

3. The report mentions that the tumor probably does not involve the pleura, and this is confirmed by special stains in the addendum report. Therefore, there is no pleural invasion (PL0).

4. The report states that there is no vascular or perineural invasion, and no metastases to hilar lymph nodes are seen. This suggests that the N stage is N0.

5. The report does not mention any distant metastases, so the M stage is Mx (unknown).

6. Based on the TNM staging system, a T2N0Mx corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
10,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Tumor size: 3 X 3 X 3 cm, which corresponds to T2 (tumor > 3 cm in greatest dimension).
2. Tumor extent: Visceral pleura, which indicates T2a (tumor invades visceral pleura).
3. Lymph nodes: 1/1 positive for metastasis (Intrathoracical 1/1), which corresponds to N1 (metastasis in ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes).
4. No evidence of distant metastasis (M0) is mentioned in the report.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2a tumor with N1 lymph node involvement and no distant metastasis corresponds to Stage IIIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IIIA""}"
11,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor size is 4.0 X 3.5 X 2.0 cm, which corresponds to a T2 classification according to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual (tumors >3 cm but ≤5 cm in greatest dimension).

2. The report mentions ""Infiltration of pleura visceralis"", which indicates that the tumor has invaded the visceral pleura. This does not affect the T classification, as it is already T2.

3. The lymph node status is pNO (0/20), indicating that no lymph nodes are involved. This corresponds to an N0 classification.

4. The report does not mention any distant metastases, and the pMx classification indicates that the presence of distant metastases cannot be assessed. However, in the absence of any evidence of distant metastases, we can assume that the M classification is M0.

5. Combining the T, N, and M classifications, we get a stage of T2N0M0, which corresponds to Stage II according to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
12,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and presence of distant metastases.

From the pathology report, we can gather the following information:

* Tumor size: 2.7 cm in diameter (T1)
* Lymph node involvement: 1 out of 4 peribronchial lymph nodes are positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma (N1)
* No distant metastases are mentioned in the report
* The tumor does not involve the pleura, and the bronchial margin is not involved
* There is no extracapsular extension of the tumor in the lymph nodes

Based on the TNM staging system, a T1 tumor with N1 lymph node involvement corresponds to Stage IIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IIA}"
13,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (T)**: The tumor size is 1.2 cm, and it focally invades into, but not through, the visceral pleura. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual, this corresponds to a T2 tumor.
2. **Lymph Nodes (N)**: The report states that 7 lymph nodes were examined, and none of them were involved with cancer (0/7). This corresponds to an N0 lymph node status.
3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: There is no mention of distant metastases in the report. Therefore, we can assume that the M status is MX, which means that the presence or absence of distant metastases cannot be assessed.

Based on the TNM staging system, we can determine the overall stage of the cancer. With a T2 primary tumor, N0 lymph node status, and MX distant metastasis status, the patient's cancer is classified as **Stage I**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
14,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Primary tumor (T): The report mentions a 4 cm adenocarcinoma, acinar type, grade III, invading visceral pleura in the right lower lobe. This corresponds to a pT2 tumor, as it is larger than 3 cm but not more than 5 cm, and invades the visceral pleura.

2. Lymph nodes (N): The report shows metastatic adenocarcinoma in two of four lymph nodes (2/4) in the right lower lobe, and in one of five lymph nodes (1/5) in level 7 lymph node. This indicates that there is involvement of mediastinal lymph nodes, which corresponds to an N2 designation.

3. Distant metastasis (M): There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so it is classified as Mx (cannot be assessed).

Based on the above, the AJCC stage is pT2, N2, Mx, which corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
15,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to analyze the pathology report and identify the key factors that influence staging.

1. **Primary Tumor (T)**: The tumor is described as an ""invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma"" with a size of 9.2 cm in greatest dimension, invading into the chest wall (pT3).
2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N)**: The report states that 19 peribronchial lymph nodes are negative for carcinoma (0/19), and 6 lymph nodes from levels 1-9 are also negative (0/6). This indicates that there is no lymph node involvement (N0).
3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so we can assume that M0 (no distant metastasis).

Based on these factors, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* T3 (primary tumor size > 5 cm and invading into the chest wall)
* N0 (no lymph node involvement)
* M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 7th Edition, the stage corresponding to these factors is:

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
16,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The tumor size is 6.9 x 4.7 x 4.1 cm, which is greater than 5 cm but less than or equal to 7 cm. This corresponds to a T2b primary tumor.
* The tumor extends to the visceral pleural surface, but there is no evidence of tumor extension to the chest wall or other attached tissues.
* Lymphangitic invasion is identified, which suggests lymphatic invasion.
* The bronchial and vascular resection margins are negative for carcinoma.
* There are multiple lymph nodes involved with metastatic adenocarcinoma, including one lymph node in the left level 9 station, two lymph nodes in the left level 11 station, and four lymph nodes in the left lower lobe. This corresponds to N2 regional lymph node involvement.

There is no evidence of distant metastasis (M0).

Based on the TNM descriptors, the patient has a pT2b primary tumor, pN2 regional lymph node involvement, and no distant metastasis (M0). According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, this corresponds to Stage IIIA lung cancer.

Therefore, the answer is -

17,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the Cancer.

1. The report appears to be a general pathology report information form, which provides details about the tumor type, specimen, and diagnosis.
2. There is no specific information about the tumor size, lymph node involvement, or metastasis, which are crucial factors in determining the AJCC Stage.
3. The report does not provide any information about the TNM classification (T - tumor size, N - lymph node involvement, M - metastasis), which is essential for determining the AJCC Stage.
4. Without the TNM classification, it is not possible to determine the AJCC Stage accurately.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Cannot be determined from the provided information""}"
18,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the Cancer:

1. The diagnosis mentions a peripheral, well-differentiated papillary, non-mucigenous adenocarcinoma measuring 50 mm, which indicates the primary tumor size (T).
2. The report states that the tumor extends as far as the visceral pleura, but it is tumor-free, indicating that the tumor has not invaded the pleura (no pleural invasion).
3. The tumor classification is provided as pT2, which corresponds to a tumor larger than 3 cm but not larger than 5 cm (50 mm is approximately 2 inches, which falls within this range).
4. The report also mentions that the bronchial resection margin is tumor-free (R0), indicating that the tumor has been completely resected.
5. The lymph node status is reported as pN0, indicating that there is no regional lymph node metastasis.
6. The report does not mention any distant metastasis (pMX), which suggests that there is no evidence of distant spread.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC Stage of the Cancer as follows:

* Tumor size (T): pT2 (larger than 3 cm but not larger than 5 cm)
* Lymph node status (N): pN0 (no regional lymph node metastasis)
* Distant metastasis (M): pMX (no evidence of distant spread)

According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a size of pT2, no lymph node metastasis (pN0), and no distant metastasis (pMX) corresponds to Stage I B.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I B""}"
19,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor is located in the left upper lobe, and its size is 4.5 cm (T2a).
2. Visceral pleural invasion is present, which does not affect the T stage.
3. Lymphovascular space invasion is present, which also does not affect the T stage.
4. The tumor is confined to the lung, with no extension to other organs.
5. The surgical margin status shows that the tumor is 4.5 cm away from the bronchial margin, and the pleural surface is involved.
6. Lymph node status reveals that out of 6 lymph nodes received, 1 lymph node contains metastatic carcinoma (N1).
7. There is no mention of distant metastases (M0).

Based on the above information, the pTNM stage is pT2aN1MX.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a tumor with a T2a primary, N1 lymph node involvement, and no distant metastases (M0) corresponds to Stage IIA.

Therefore, the answer is -

20,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the Cancer.

1. The tumor site is the lung, and the tumor size is 2.5 X 1.5 X 3 cm, which is a significant size but not explicitly stated to be invading nearby structures or organs.

2. The histologic type is bronchiolo-alveolar adenocarcinoma, which is a type of non-small cell lung cancer. The histologic grade is poorly differentiated, indicating aggressive tumor behavior.

3. However, there is no information about tumor extent, lymph node involvement, lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, or margin status, which are crucial factors in determining the AJCC Stage.

4. Without this information, we cannot determine if the tumor has invaded nearby structures, lymph nodes, or distant organs, which would indicate a higher stage.

5. Given the available information, the tumor size is the only factor that can be used to determine the T category, which would be T2 (tumor size > 2 cm but ≤ 5 cm).

6. Since there is no information about lymph node involvement or distant metastases, we cannot determine the N or M categories.

7. Based on the available information, the most likely stage would be Stage I, as the tumor size is significant but there is no evidence of lymph node involvement or distant metastases.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Primary tumor (pT): The report states that the primary tumor is pT1b, which means the tumor is 2.5 cm in greatest dimension, but has not invaded the visceral pleura.

2. Regional lymph nodes: The report mentions that five lymph nodes were examined, and all were negative for malignancy (0/5). This indicates that there is no lymph node involvement.

3. Distant metastasis: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* T stage: T1b (primary tumor 2.5 cm in greatest dimension, but has not invaded the visceral pleura)
* N stage: N0 (no lymph node involvement)
* M stage: M0 (no distant metastasis)

3. There is no distant metastasis mentioned in the report (M0).
4. The report also mentions that the margins are uninvolved (negative), and there is no pleural invasion or obstructive pneumonitis.

Based on these findings, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* Tumor size (pT1) corresponds to Stage I or II.
* Lymph node involvement (N2) corresponds to Stage III.
* No distant metastasis (M0) rules out Stage IV.

Considering the lymph node involvement, the correct stage is Stage III.

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor size is 6.5 x 6.5 x 5.0 cm, which corresponds to a pT2b classification according to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual. This indicates that the tumor is larger than 4 cm but not larger than 5 cm.

2. The report states ""No Infiltration of pleura visceralis"", which means there is no invasion of the visceral pleura. This is important because invasion of the visceral pleura would upgrade the T classification to pT3.

3. The lymph node status is pN1, indicating that there are metastases in 6 out of 28 lymph nodes examined. This is a key factor in determining the overall stage.

4. The report states pMx, which means that the presence of distant metastases cannot be assessed. However, since there is no mention of distant metastases, we can assume that there are no distant metastases.

5. Based on the AJCC 8th edition staging manual, a pT2b tumor with pN1 lymph node status and no distant metastases corresponds to Stage IIA.

Therefore, the answer is -

The patient's pathology report indicates that the tumor has invaded the pleura, but not through it, and there is lymphovascular invasion present. The tumor size is 5.0 X 4.1 X 2.4 cm, which corresponds to a T2 tumor. The report also mentions that there are metastases to multiple lymph nodes, including the left lung #6 anterior and anterior left, left hilar, left lung #10 tracheobronchial, and left lung AP window lymph nodes. This corresponds to an N2 nodal status.

The report does not mention any distant metastases, so the M status is MX (cannot be assessed).

According to the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, a T2 tumor with N2 nodal status and MX distant metastasis status corresponds to Stage IIIA.

Therefore, the answer is -

26,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to analyze the pathology report and identify the key factors that influence staging.

1. **Primary Tumor (T)**: The tumor size is 3.5 cm, and it is located in the left upper lobe. There is no visceral pleura invasion, atelectasis, or obstructive pneumonitis. Therefore, the T stage is T2a (tumor 3-4 cm in greatest dimension).

2. **Lymph Nodes (N)**: The report mentions that 2 of 2 peribronchial nodes are positive for metastatic tumor, and 3 out of 12 lymph nodes are involved. This indicates that the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes. The N stage is N1 (metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial and/or hilar lymph nodes).

3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report. Therefore, the M stage is MX (distant metastasis cannot be assessed).

Based on the TNM staging system, the AJCC stage is determined by combining the T, N, and M stages. In this case, the stage is II (T2a, N1, MX).

Therefore, the answer is -

3. Vascular invasion: Not identified
4. Lymphatic invasion: Pending (not relevant for staging)
5. Bronchial margin: Negative, but tumor cells are present within lymphatic spaces
6. Vascular margin: Negative
7. Parenchymal margins: Not applicable
8. Pleura/soft tissue margin: The tumor invades into the visceral pleura
9. Lymph node involvement: Metastatic adenocarcinoma in peribronchial lymph nodes (pN2)

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor is a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, which is a type of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
2. The tumor measures 58 mm in maximum dimension, which corresponds to T2a (tumor > 4 cm but ≤ 5 cm).
3. The tumor invades the visceral pleura and chest wall fibrous connective tissue, which corresponds to T3 (tumor invades the chest wall).
4. There is no lymphatic or perineural invasion, but blood vessel invasion is present.
5. No lymph node metastases are seen in the hilar lymph nodes (1B) or peri-oesophageal lymph node (3).
6. The tumor is clear of the bronchial resection margin.
7. The supplementary report shows no residual malignancy within the chest wall tissues, and no involvement of rib bone or soft tissue resection margin.

Based on these findings, the TNM classification is:

* T3: Tumor invades the chest wall
* N0: No lymph node metastases
* M0: No distant metastases (not mentioned in the report, but assumed to be absent)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T3N0M0 corresponds to Stage IIIA.

29,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the cancer.

1. The report provides information about the tumor size (T), lymph node involvement (N), and distant metastasis (M).
2. The tumor size is described as T2, which means the tumor is larger than 3 cm but not larger than 5 cm.
3. The lymph node involvement is described as N1, which means there is metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes.
4. The distant metastasis is described as M0, which means there is no distant metastasis.

Now, let's refer to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer:

* Stage I: T1-2, N0, M0 (tumor limited to the lung, no lymph node involvement, and no distant metastasis)
* Stage II: T1-2, N1, M0 (tumor limited to the lung, with ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph node involvement, and no distant metastasis)
* Stage III: T1-3, N2, M0 or T3, N1-2, M0 (tumor with more extensive lymph node involvement or invasion of nearby structures)
* Stage IV: Any T, Any N, M1 (tumor with distant metastasis)

Based on the pathology report, the patient has a T2 tumor with N1 lymph node involvement and no distant metastasis (M0). This matches the description of Stage II.

1. **Tumor size and extent**: The tumor size is 3.5 cm, which corresponds to T2a according to the AJCC 8th edition staging system (tumors > 2 cm but ≤ 3 cm in size).
2. **Lymph node involvement**: The report states that 0/7 hilar lymph nodes are positive for metastasis, indicating that there is no lymph node involvement (N0).
3. **Distant metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report.
4. **Margins**: The margins are uninvolved, indicating that the tumor has not invaded the surgical margins.

Based on these findings, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* T2a (tumor size 3.5 cm)
* N0 (no lymph node involvement)
* M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2a, N0, M0 corresponds to **Stage I**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"

1. The tumor site is the upper lobe of the right lung, and there are two separate tumor nodules in the same lobe.
2. The tumor sizes are 3.7 cm, 2.9 x 2.8 cm, and 1.2 cm x 0.8 cm x 0.7 cm.
3. There is no visceral pleural invasion, and the tumor extension is not identified.
4. The margins are uninvolved by invasive carcinoma, with a distance of 3.4 cm from the closest margin (parenchymal margin).
5. Lymphovascular invasion is not identified.
6. The number of lymph nodes examined is 11, and none of them are involved (pNO).
7. The pathologic staging is reported as Stage IIB, with a pT3 (tumor size > 3 cm) and pNO (no lymph node involvement).

Based on the above information, the correct answer is:

Therefore, the answer is - {""stage"" : Stage IIB}"
32,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to analyze the pathology report and identify the key factors that influence staging.

1. **Primary Tumor (PT)**: The tumor size is 3.5 cm, which corresponds to T2 (Tumor greater than 3 cm in greatest dimension).
2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (PN)**: There are metastases in ipsilateral peribronchial and ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes, which corresponds to N1 (Metastases in ipsilateral peribronchial and ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes).
3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: There is no evidence of distant metastasis, so M is MX (Cannot be assessed).
4. **Margins**: The margins are uninvolved by invasive carcinoma, and the distance of invasive tumor from the closest margin is 5 mm.
5. **Direct Extension of Tumor**: The tumor has extended to the visceral pleura.
6. **Venous (Large Vessel) Invasion (V)**: Present.
7. **Arterial (Large Vessel) Invasion**: Present.
8. **Lymphatic (Small Vessel) Invasion (L)**: Present.

Considering these factors, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* T2 (Primary Tumor)
* N1 (Regional Lymph Nodes)
* MX (Distant Metastasis)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2N1MX corresponds to **Stage III**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
33,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Primary tumor (pT): The primary tumor measures 2.5 cm in greatest dimensions, and there is a suggestion of visceral pleural invasion. This corresponds to a pT2a tumor.

2. Regional lymph nodes (pN): The level 12 lymph nodes demonstrate four nodes with evidence of metastasis. This indicates that the cancer has spread to the regional lymph nodes, which corresponds to a pN2 tumor.

3. Distant metastasis (pM): The report states that distant metastasis cannot be evaluated by this specimen, so we cannot determine if there is distant metastasis or not.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage of the cancer. The primary tumor is pT2a, and the regional lymph nodes are pN2. According to the AJCC staging system, this corresponds to Stage IIIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IIIA""}"
34,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Primary tumor (pT): The tumor measures 3.5 cm in maximum dimension and invades into the pleura, which corresponds to pT2.
2. Margins of resection: Negative, which means the tumor does not extend to the resection margins.
3. Vascular invasion: Present, which is a poor prognostic factor.
4. Regional lymph nodes (pN): pNX, which means the lymph node status is unknown.
5. Distant metastasis (pM): pMX, which means the presence or absence of distant metastases is unknown.

Based on the above information, we can determine the T, N, and M stages as follows:

* T stage: T2 (tumor measures 3.5 cm and invades into the pleura)
* N stage: NX (lymph node status is unknown)
* M stage: MX (distant metastasis status is unknown)

According to the AJCC staging system, a T2 tumor with unknown lymph node and distant metastasis status corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
35,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the Cancer.

1. The report mentions ""Pathologic stage is T2N0MX"". This indicates that the tumor is classified as T2 (tumor size >2 cm but ≤5 cm), N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis), and MX (distant metastasis cannot be assessed).

2. The tumor size is 2.8 cm, which falls within the T2 category.

3. There is no lymph node involvement (N0), as all sampled lymph nodes are benign.

4. There is no mention of distant metastasis, so MX is assigned.

5. According to the AJCC staging system, a T2N0MX classification corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
36,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor site is in the middle lobe of the right lung, and the maximum tumor size is 5.5 x 5.0 cm, which is a significant size.
2. The histologic type is non-small cell carcinoma, and the grade is G3, poorly differentiated.
3. There is no visceral pleural invasion, but the tumor extends into the fissure.
4. The bronchial margin is negative for tumor, and there is no squamous cell carcinoma in situ identified.
5. The vascular parenchymal parietal pleural margins are all negative for carcinoma.
6. Lymph vascular invasion is indeterminate but favors present in block 4.
7. Twelve lymph nodes were examined, including parts A through E, and block F1, which is negative for carcinoma.
8. The pathologic stage is reported as pT2, but the M stage is not explicitly stated.

Based on the above information, we can determine the T stage as T2 (tumor size > 4 cm but ≤ 5 cm) and the N stage as N2 (tumor extends into the fissure and lymph vascular invasion is present). Since there is no evidence of distant metastasis, the M stage is M0.

According to the AJCC staging system, a T2N2M0 corresponds to Stage IIIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IIIA}"
37,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the right lung, and its size is 7 cm (mentioned in the final diagnosis of the right lung, pneumonectomy).
2. There is no invasion of the visceral pleura (mentioned in the final diagnosis of the right lung, pneumonectomy).
3. The bronchial and vascular margins are negative (mentioned in the final diagnosis of the right lung, pneumonectomy).
4. No tumor is seen in the lymph nodes of levels 4, 7, and 9 (mentioned in the final diagnosis of the corresponding lymph nodes).
5. However, the tumor has not metastasized to distant organs or sites (not mentioned in the report).

Based on the above information, we can determine the T, N, and M stages as follows:

* T stage: T2 (tumor size is 7 cm, but there is no invasion of the visceral pleura)
* N stage: N0 (no tumor is seen in any of the lymph nodes)
* M stage: M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC staging system, a T2N0M0 corresponds to Stage IIA. However, since the options provided do not include Stage IIA, we need to consider the closest match.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
38,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Primary tumor (pT): The report states that the tumor size is 3.5 cm, which corresponds to a pT2a classification (tumor more than 3 cm but 5 cm or less).

2. Regional lymph nodes (pN): The report indicates that there is metastatic carcinoma in 3 of 18 lymph nodes, which corresponds to a pN1 classification (metastasis in ipsilateral peribronchial lymph nodes).

3. Distant metastasis (pM): There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so we can assume pM0 (no distant metastasis).

Based on the AJCC staging system, a pT2a primary tumor, pN1 regional lymph nodes, and pM0 distant metastasis correspond to Stage IIA.

However, the report also mentions that the metastatic carcinoma is in ipsilateral peribronchial lymph nodes, which is a characteristic of Stage IIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IIA}"
