The pathology report provides detailed information about the lung cancer diagnosis. Let's break down the key elements relevant to staging:

1. **Primary Tumor (pT):** The report indicates a pT2a classification. This means the tumor is greater than 3 cm but 5 cm or less in greatest dimension, surrounded by lung or visceral pleura without bronchoscopic evidence of invasion more proximal than the lobar bronchus.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN):** The report states pN0, indicating no regional lymph node metastasis. All lymph nodes examined (levels 5, 7, and 9) were negative for carcinoma.

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM):** The report mentions ""Not applicable"" for distant metastasis, implying no evidence of distant spread.

4. **Multiple Primary Tumors:** The report notes ""m"" for multiple primary tumors, indicating synchronous carcinomas in the lingula and left lower lobe. However, this does not affect the staging of each individual tumor.

Based on the TNM classification provided (pT2a, pN0, pM0), the cancer is classified as Stage IB according to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer. However, since the options provided do not include Stage IB, we must choose the closest option, which is Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
1,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging the lung cancer:

1. **Tumor Size and Characteristics**: The tumor is an adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated, located in the subpleural right lower lung lobe, with a size of 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.6 cm. It shows pleural invasion but no lymphovascular space invasion.

2. **Lymph Node Status**: All lymph nodes examined (R lymph node, L lymph node, Station 11, Station 12, and Station 7) are negative for neoplasm, indicating no regional lymph node metastasis.

3. **Staging Information**: The report explicitly states the stage as T2N0. 

- **T2** indicates a tumor size greater than 3 cm but less than or equal to 5 cm, or a tumor that involves the main bronchus, invades visceral pleura, or is associated with atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis that extends to the hilar region but does not involve the entire lung.
- **N0** indicates no regional lymph node metastasis.

According to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for lung cancer, a T2N0 classification corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
2,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to consider the TNM classification provided in the pathology report:

1. **Primary Tumor (pT):** The report states pT1b, which indicates a tumor size greater than 2 cm but 3 cm or less in greatest dimension. The tumor is described as minimally invasive adenocarcinoma, well-differentiated, with no visceral pleura invasion or extension beyond the pleura.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN):** The report states pN1, which indicates that there is metastasis in ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes and intrapulmonary nodes, including involvement by direct extension. Specifically, 1 out of 17 lymph nodes examined was positive for malignancy.

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM):** The report states pMX, which means that distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Based on the TNM classification:
- **T1b** indicates a small tumor size.
- **N1** indicates regional lymph node involvement.
- **MX** means distant metastasis is not assessed, but there is no evidence of distant metastasis provided in the report.

According to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer:
- Stage I typically involves T1 or T2 tumors with N0 (no regional lymph node involvement).
- Stage II can involve T1 or T2 tumors with N1 (regional lymph node involvement).
- Stage III involves more extensive lymph node involvement (N2 or N3) or larger tumors (T3 or T4).
- Stage IV involves distant metastasis (M1).

Given the information:
- The tumor is T1b.
- There is N1 lymph node involvement.
- There is no evidence of distant metastasis (M0 or MX).

Therefore, the cancer is classified as Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
3,"## Answer
The pathology report provides several key pieces of information that are crucial for determining the AJCC stage of the cancer:

1. **Tumor Size and Extent of Invasion (T category):** The maximum tumor size is reported as 2.5 x 2.0 cm, and the extent of invasion is classified as pT1. This indicates a relatively small tumor that is limited to the lung.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N category):** The report states pN2, with ten of twelve lymph nodes involved by metastatic carcinoma, including the subcarinal lymph node. N2 indicates metastasis to ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M category):** The report indicates pMX, meaning that distant metastasis cannot be assessed. However, there is no mention of confirmed distant metastasis.

Based on the AJCC staging system for lung cancer:
- **Stage I** typically involves a small tumor (T1) with no lymph node involvement (N0) and no distant metastasis (M0).
- **Stage II** involves a larger tumor or limited lymph node involvement (N1) but no distant metastasis.
- **Stage III** involves more extensive lymph node involvement (N2 or N3) and/or a larger tumor, but no confirmed distant metastasis.
- **Stage IV** involves distant metastasis (M1).

Given the information:
- The tumor is small (T1).
- There is significant lymph node involvement (N2).
- There is no confirmed distant metastasis (pMX).

Therefore, the cancer is best classified as **Stage III** due to the N2 lymph node involvement.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
4,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging the cancer:

1. **Primary Tumor (T):** The tumor is described as an invasive poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma measuring 2.7 cm in greatest dimension and invades the visceral pleura. This corresponds to a classification of pT2a according to the AJCC staging system.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):** The report states that two lymph nodes were examined and both were negative for metastatic carcinoma, which corresponds to pN0.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** There is no mention of distant metastasis, which implies M0.

Based on the AJCC 7th edition TNM staging system for lung cancer:
- T2a indicates a tumor size greater than 2 cm but less than or equal to 3 cm, or a tumor that invades the visceral pleura.
- N0 indicates no regional lymph node metastasis.
- M0 indicates no distant metastasis.

Combining these, the cancer is staged as Stage IB (T2a, N0, M0) according to the AJCC 7th edition for lung cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
5,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging:

1. **Primary Tumor (pT):** The tumor is classified as pT1b, which indicates a tumor greater than 2 cm but 3 cm or less in greatest dimension, surrounded by lung or visceral pleura, without bronchoscopic evidence of invasion more proximal than the lobar bronchus.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN):** The report indicates pN0, meaning there is no regional lymph node metastasis. All sampled lymph nodes (levels 4, 7, and 10) are negative for carcinoma.

3. **Distant Metastases (pM):** The report states ""Not applicable"" for distant metastases, which typically implies that there is no evidence of distant metastasis (pM0).

Based on the AJCC staging system for lung cancer, a tumor classified as pT1b, pN0, and pM0 corresponds to Stage I. Specifically, it would be Stage IA2, but since the options provided are general stages, it falls under Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
6,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the lung cancer from the pathology report, we need to consider the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and any distant metastasis.

1. **Tumor Size (T):** The report describes an invasive adenocarcinoma forming a 5 x 4 x 3 cm mass in the right lower lobe. According to AJCC staging, a tumor greater than 4 cm but less than or equal to 5 cm is classified as T2b.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N):** The report indicates that one of six intrapulmonary peribronchial lymph nodes is positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma. This suggests N1 involvement, which is defined as metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes and intrapulmonary nodes, including involvement by direct extension.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so we assume M0.

Based on the above information:
- T2b (tumor size > 4 cm but ≤ 5 cm)
- N1 (metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes)
- M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system for lung cancer, a T2b N1 M0 classification corresponds to Stage IIB.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
7,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging:

1. **Tumor Size and Extent (T):** The tumor is 2.3 cm in greatest diameter, which corresponds to T1b (tumor >2 cm but ≤3 cm in greatest dimension). The carcinoma extends up to but not through the visceral pleura, indicating no pleural invasion beyond the visceral pleura.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N):** The report indicates ""no metastatic carcinoma identified"" in the lymph nodes examined (0/2 in level 7, 0/3 in peribronchial, 0/1 in level 9, and fragmented nodes in level 4 with no metastasis). This corresponds to N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis).

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, which implies M0 (no distant metastasis).

Based on the TNM classification provided (pT1b N0 M0), the cancer is classified as Stage I according to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
8,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to consider the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and any distant metastasis.

1. **Tumor Size (T):** The tumor is described as an invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with a size of 3.5 cm. According to AJCC staging, a tumor size of 3.5 cm would typically be classified as T2 (greater than 3 cm but less than or equal to 5 cm).

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N):** The report indicates metastatic adenocarcinoma involving 1 of 5 hilar lymph nodes. This suggests N1 involvement, as there is metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial and/or hilar lymph nodes.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so we assume M0.

Based on the TNM classification:
- T2 (tumor size 3.5 cm)
- N1 (metastasis to 1 hilar lymph node)
- M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC staging system, a T2 N1 M0 classification corresponds to Stage II cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
9,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to consider the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and metastasis status as described in the pathology report.

1. **Tumor Size and Local Invasion (T):** 
   - The tumor measures approximately 50 x 60 x 45 mm, which places it in the T2 category (tumor size >3 cm but ≤5 cm or involves the main bronchus without involvement of the carina, invades visceral pleura, or associated with atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis extending to the hilar region).
   - The report mentions that the tumor closely abuts the pleural surface, but no definite pleural invasion is seen, confirmed by special stains. Therefore, it remains T2.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N):**
   - The report states ""No metastases to hilar lymph nodes are seen,"" indicating N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis).

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):**
   - The report does not provide evidence of distant metastasis (Mx), but typically, if no metastasis is identified, it is considered M0.

Given the information:
- T2 (tumor size and local characteristics)
- N0 (no lymph node involvement)
- M0 (no distant metastasis)

The combination of T2N0M0 corresponds to Stage I cancer according to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
10,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the lung cancer from the pathology report, we need to consider several key factors:

1. **Tumor Size and Extent (T):** The tumor is 3 x 3 x 3 cm and involves the visceral pleura. According to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer, a tumor that is greater than 3 cm but 4 cm or less, or involves the visceral pleura, is classified as T2.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N):** The report indicates that 1 out of 1 lymph node is positive for metastasis (intrathoracic). This suggests N1 involvement, which means metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes and intrapulmonary nodes, including involvement by direct extension.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so we assume M0.

Based on these factors, the staging would be T2 N1 M0. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system for lung cancer, T2 N1 M0 corresponds to Stage IIB.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
11,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to consider the TNM classification provided in the pathology report:

1. **Tumor Size and Extent (T):** The report states ""pT2"". According to the AJCC staging system, T2 indicates a tumor size greater than 3 cm but less than or equal to 5 cm, or a tumor that involves the main bronchus or invades the visceral pleura. In this case, the tumor is 4.0 cm and there is infiltration of the pleura visceralis, which fits the criteria for T2.

2. **Lymph Nodes (N):** The report states ""pN0 (0/20)"", which means there is no regional lymph node metastasis. N0 indicates that the cancer has not spread to nearby lymph nodes.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** The report states ""pMx"", which means that the presence of distant metastasis cannot be assessed. However, for staging purposes, if there is no evidence of metastasis, it is often considered as M0 unless specified otherwise.

Given these factors:
- T2
- N0
- M0 (assumed due to pMx)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system for lung cancer:
- T2 N0 M0 corresponds to Stage IIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
12,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to consider the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and any distant metastasis.

1. **Tumor Size (T):** The tumor is 2.7 cm in diameter. According to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer, a tumor size of 2.7 cm falls under T1 (specifically T1b, which is for tumors >2 cm but ≤3 cm).

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N):** The pathology report indicates that there is metastatic adenocarcinoma in 1 out of 4 peribronchial lymph nodes. The other lymph nodes (R4 and station 11) show no metastatic carcinoma. Involvement of peribronchial lymph nodes corresponds to N1, which indicates metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial or hilar lymph nodes.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so we assume M0.

Based on the above information:
- T1b (tumor size >2 cm but ≤3 cm)
- N1 (metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial lymph nodes)
- M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system for lung cancer, a T1b N1 M0 classification corresponds to Stage IIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
13,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging the cancer:

1. **Tumor Size and Invasion**: The tumor is 1.2 cm in size and invades into, but not through, the visceral pleura. This corresponds to a T2 classification in the TNM staging system.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: A total of 7 lymph nodes were examined, and none were found to be involved with cancer (0/7). This corresponds to an N0 classification.

3. **Distant Metastasis**: The report indicates pMX, meaning that the presence of distant metastasis cannot be assessed from the information provided.

Based on the TNM classification provided (pT2, pN0, pMX), we can determine the stage of the cancer:

- **Stage I**: Typically involves T1 or T2 tumors with N0 and M0.
- **Stage II**: Typically involves T2 tumors with N1 or T3 tumors with N0 and M0.
- **Stage III**: Typically involves T3 or T4 tumors with N1 or N2 and M0.
- **Stage IV**: Involves any T, any N, and M1.

Given that the tumor is T2, N0, and M0 (assuming M0 since pMX indicates metastasis cannot be assessed), this aligns with Stage I cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
14,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following information:

- **Primary Tumor (T):** The tumor is described as adenocarcinoma, acinar type, grade III, measuring 4 cm, and invading the visceral pleura. This corresponds to a T2 classification, as the tumor is more than 3 cm but less than 5 cm and involves the visceral pleura.

- **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):** Metastatic adenocarcinoma is found in two of four lymph nodes, including level 7 lymph nodes. This indicates N2 classification, as it involves metastasis to ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes.

- **Distant Metastasis (M):** The report states Mx, meaning distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

According to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for lung cancer:

- **Stage III** is characterized by T1-T2, N2, M0 or T3, N1-N2, M0. Given the classification of T2, N2, and Mx (where Mx does not confirm distant metastasis), the cancer is consistent with Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
15,"## Answer
The pathology report provides detailed information about the cancer diagnosis and staging. Let's break down the key points:

1. **Tumor Size and Invasion**: The tumor is an invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, measuring 9.2 cm in greatest dimension, and it invades into the chest wall. This indicates a T3 classification according to the AJCC staging system, as the tumor is larger than 7 cm or directly invades the chest wall.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report indicates that there is no lymph node involvement. All examined lymph nodes (N1 and N2) are negative for carcinoma (0/19 peribronchial lymph nodes and 0/6 mediastinal/subcarinal lymph nodes). This suggests an N0 classification.

3. **Metastasis**: The report does not provide information on distant metastasis (Mx), which means metastasis cannot be assessed from the provided data.

Based on the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 7th Edition, the pathological staging is pT3, N0, Mx. In the absence of lymph node involvement (N0) and without evidence of distant metastasis (Mx), the cancer is classified as Stage IIB.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
16,"## Answer
The pathology report provides several key pieces of information that are crucial for determining the AJCC stage of the cancer:

1. **Primary Tumor (pT):** The tumor is described as ""pT2b,"" which indicates a tumor greater than 5 cm but 7 cm or less in greatest dimension. This size categorization is consistent with a T2 classification.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN):** The report indicates ""pN2,"" which means there is metastasis in ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes. Specifically, 7 out of 19 lymph nodes are involved, including lymph nodes at levels 9 and 11, which are mediastinal.

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM):** The report states ""Not applicable"" for distant metastasis, suggesting there is no evidence of distant metastasis (M0).

Based on the TNM classification:
- T2b indicates a moderately large tumor.
- N2 indicates significant regional lymph node involvement.
- M0 indicates no distant metastasis.

According to the AJCC staging system, a combination of T2b, N2, and M0 corresponds to Stage III cancer. Stage III is characterized by larger tumors with regional lymph node involvement but no distant metastasis.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
17,"## Answer
The provided text does not contain specific information about the tumor size, lymph node involvement, or metastasis, which are critical components for determining the AJCC stage of cancer. The text appears to be instructions for completing a pathology report form rather than an actual pathology report with diagnostic details. Without specific details such as T (tumor size), N (lymph node involvement), and M (metastasis) classifications, it is not possible to determine the AJCC stage of cancer.

Therefore, the answer is -

20,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to consider several factors from the pathology report, including tumor size, lymph node involvement, and metastasis. Let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Tumor Size**: The tumor size is given as 2.5 x 1.5 x 3 cm. According to AJCC staging for lung cancer, a tumor size of 3 cm or less typically corresponds to T1.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report states ""Lymph nodes: Not specified."" Without evidence of lymph node involvement, we assume N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis).

3. **Distant Metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so we assume M0 (no distant metastasis).

4. **Histologic Type and Grade**: The histologic type is bronchiolo-alveolar adenocarcinoma, and it is poorly differentiated. While histologic grade can influence prognosis, it does not directly affect the AJCC staging.

5. **Other Factors**: The report does not specify tumor extent, lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, or margins, which are important for a complete staging assessment. However, based on the available information, we proceed with the assumption of no additional complications.

Given the tumor size (T1), no lymph node involvement (N0), and no distant metastasis (M0), the cancer would be classified as Stage I according to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer.

Therefore, the answer is -

The pathology report provides several key pieces of information that are crucial for determining the AJCC stage of the cancer:

1. **Tumor Size and Location**: The primary tumor is described as poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with a size of 1.7 cm. It is located in the right upper lobe of the lung.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: There is metastatic carcinoma identified in multiple lymph nodes, including level 7, level 12, and R4, with capsular penetration noted. This indicates significant lymph node involvement.

3. **Distant Metastasis**: The report does not provide explicit evidence of distant metastasis (MX), but the presence of extensive lymph node involvement suggests advanced disease.

4. **AJCC Staging Information**: The report explicitly mentions ""AJCC pT1N2MX,"" which indicates:
   - **pT1**: The primary tumor is 3 cm or less in greatest dimension.
   - **N2**: Metastasis to ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes.
   - **MX**: Distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Based on the AJCC staging system for lung cancer:
- **Stage IIIA**: T1N2M0, which corresponds to a tumor that is 3 cm or less with metastasis to ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes, but no distant metastasis.

Therefore, the information provided in the pathology report aligns with Stage III cancer due to the T1N2 classification.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
23,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging:

1. **Primary Tumor (pT):** The tumor is classified as pT1a, which indicates a tumor that is 2 cm or less in greatest dimension, surrounded by lung or visceral pleura, without invasion more proximal than the lobar bronchus.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN):** The classification is pN0, indicating no regional lymph node metastasis. All lymph nodes examined were negative for malignancy.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, which implies M0 (no distant metastasis).

According to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for lung cancer:

- **Stage I:** Typically includes T1a or T1b with N0 and M0.
- **Stage II:** Involves larger tumors or limited nodal involvement.
- **Stage III:** Involves more extensive nodal involvement or larger tumors.
- **Stage IV:** Involves distant metastasis.

Given the tumor size (2 cm), lack of lymph node involvement (N0), and no distant metastasis (M0), the cancer is classified as Stage I.

24,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to consider the TNM classification provided in the pathology report:

1. **Tumor Size and Extent (T):** The report states ""pT2b"". According to the AJCC 8th edition for lung cancer, T2b indicates a tumor size greater than 5 cm but less than or equal to 7 cm, or a tumor that involves the main bronchus without involvement of the carina, invades visceral pleura, or is associated with atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis that extends to the hilar region but does not involve the entire lung.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):** The report states ""pN1 (6/28)"". N1 indicates metastasis in ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes and intrapulmonary nodes, including involvement by direct extension.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** The report states ""pMx"", which means that the presence of distant metastasis cannot be assessed. However, for staging purposes, we typically assume M0 unless there is evidence of metastasis.

4. **Grade (G):** The report mentions ""G3"", which indicates a poorly differentiated tumor, but grading does not directly affect the AJCC stage.

Based on the TNM classification:
- T2b
- N1
- M0 (assumed)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging for lung cancer:
- T2b, N1, M0 corresponds to Stage IIB.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
25,"## Answer
The pathology report provides detailed information about the cancer's characteristics and spread. Let's break down the key elements:

1. **Primary Tumor (T):**
   - The larger tumor in the left upper lobe is described as invasive adenocarcinoma with a size of 5.0 x 4.1 x 2.4 cm. It invades into but not through the pleura, which corresponds to T2.
   - The smaller tumor in the left lower lobe is 1.0 cm, which corresponds to T1.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):**
   - Multiple lymph nodes are positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma. Specifically, there is metastasis to lymph nodes in the left lung #6, #10, and AP window, as well as direct extension into intraparenchymal and peribronchial lymph nodes.
   - The involvement of multiple lymph node regions, including mediastinal and hilar nodes, corresponds to N2.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):**
   - The report indicates MX, meaning distant metastasis cannot be assessed. However, there is no mention of confirmed distant metastasis.

Based on the AJCC staging system for lung cancer:
- T2, N2, MX for the larger tumor and T1, N2, MX for the smaller tumor both suggest a stage where the primary tumor is of moderate size, and there is significant regional lymph node involvement without confirmed distant metastasis.

Therefore, the cancer is classified as Stage III, as it involves significant lymph node involvement (N2) but lacks confirmed distant metastasis (M0 or MX).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
26,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging:

1. **Primary Tumor (T):** The tumor is located in the left upper lobe of the lung, is 3.5 cm in size, and is classified as invasive adenocarcinoma. The TNM classification given is pT2a. According to the AJCC 8th edition, a T2a tumor is greater than 3 cm but 5 cm or less, or it involves the main bronchus without involvement of the carina, invades visceral pleura, or is associated with atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis that extends to the hilar region but does not involve the entire lung.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):** The report indicates that 2 of 2 peribronchial nodes are positive for metastatic tumor, and 1 hilar node is positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma. The TNM classification given is pN1. N1 indicates metastasis in ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes and intrapulmonary nodes, including involvement by direct extension.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** The report states pMX, meaning that distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Based on the TNM classification provided (pT2a, pN1, pMX), the cancer is classified as Stage II according to the AJCC 8th edition for lung cancer. Stage II includes T2a N1 M0.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
27,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information:

1. **Tumor Size and Location**: The tumor is located in the left upper lobe and measures 3.5 x 2.8 x 2.5 cm.
2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: Metastatic adenocarcinoma is present in peribronchial lymph nodes and lymph nodes labeled 11L and #5, indicating N2 involvement.
3. **Pleural Invasion**: The tumor invades into the visceral pleura.
4. **Margins**: The bronchial margin is negative for tumor, but tumor cells are present within lymphatic spaces in the permanent section of the bronchial margin.
5. **Pathologic Stage**: The report explicitly states the pathologic stage as pT2a N2 MX, which corresponds to Stage IIIA according to the AJCC staging system.

The AJCC staging system for lung cancer considers the size and extent of the primary tumor (T), the involvement of regional lymph nodes (N), and the presence of distant metastasis (M). In this case, the tumor size and pleural invasion classify it as T2a, and the involvement of N2 lymph nodes (mediastinal or subcarinal nodes) places it in Stage IIIA. The MX indicates that distant metastasis cannot be assessed, but the N2 involvement is sufficient to determine the stage as IIIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
28,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information:

1. **Tumor Size and Invasion**: The tumor is a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma measuring 58 mm in maximal dimension. It invades through the visceral pleura to involve the chest wall fibrous connective tissue but does not involve the rib bone or soft tissue resection margin.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: There is no evidence of lymph node metastases in the hilar or peri-oesophageal lymph nodes, and the chest wall lymph nodes also show no evidence of malignancy.

3. **Distant Metastasis**: The report does not mention any distant metastasis (MX).

4. **Staging Information**: The report provides a staging of T3N0MX. 

- **T3** indicates a tumor that is more than 5 cm but less than 7 cm or a tumor that invades the chest wall, diaphragm, phrenic nerve, mediastinal pleura, or parietal pericardium.
- **N0** indicates no regional lymph node metastasis.
- **MX** indicates that distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Based on the AJCC staging system for lung cancer:
- **Stage I** typically involves T1 or T2 tumors with N0 and M0.
- **Stage II** involves T1 or T2 tumors with N1 or T3N0M0.
- **Stage III** involves T3N1 or T4 tumors or any T with N2.
- **Stage IV** involves any T, any N, and M1.

Given the T3N0MX classification, the cancer is classified as Stage II, as there is no lymph node involvement (N0) and no distant metastasis is confirmed (MX).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
29,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following information:

- Tumor size: 6.00 cm
- Pathologic T stage: T2, NOS (Not Otherwise Specified)
- Pathologic N stage: N1
- Pathologic M stage: M0

According to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system:

- T2 indicates a tumor size greater than 3 cm but 7 cm or less, or a tumor that involves the main bronchus, visceral pleura, or causes atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis extending to the hilar region.
- N1 indicates metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes and intrapulmonary nodes, including involvement by direct extension.
- M0 indicates no distant metastasis.

Based on these criteria, the combination of T2, N1, and M0 corresponds to Stage II cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
30,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information:

1. **Tumor Size**: The tumor is 3.5 x 3 cm.
2. **Histologic Type**: Adenocarcinoma, poorly differentiated (G-3).
3. **Lymph Nodes**: 0 out of 7 hilar lymph nodes are positive for metastasis, indicating no lymph node involvement.
4. **Venous Invasion**: Absent.
5. **Margins**: Uninvolved, meaning the tumor has been completely resected with no cancer cells at the margins.
6. **Tumor Extent**: Not specified, but no evidence of spread beyond the lung tissue is mentioned.

Based on the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for lung cancer:

- **Stage I**: Tumor is ≤4 cm, no lymph node involvement, and no distant metastasis.
- **Stage II**: Tumor may be larger or involve nearby structures, or there may be limited lymph node involvement.
- **Stage III**: More extensive local spread or significant lymph node involvement.
- **Stage IV**: Distant metastasis.

Given the tumor size (3.5 cm), lack of lymph node involvement (0/7), and absence of distant metastasis or venous invasion, the cancer fits the criteria for Stage I. There is no indication of spread beyond the lung or involvement of lymph nodes, which would suggest a higher stage.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
31,"## Answer
The pathology report provides detailed information about the cancer diagnosis and staging. Let's break down the key points:

1. **Tumor Characteristics**:
   - The primary tumor is located in the right upper lobe of the lung.
   - There are separate tumor nodules in the same lobe, with the largest tumor measuring 3.7 cm in greatest dimension.
   - The histologic type is adenocarcinoma, with no visceral pleural invasion or lymph-vascular invasion identified.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**:
   - A total of 11 lymph nodes were examined, and none were found to be involved with malignancy (0/11).

3. **Pathologic Staging**:
   - The report explicitly states the pathologic staging as Stage IIB, with a classification of pT3, pN0, and pM not applicable.
   - pT3 indicates a tumor greater than 5 cm or with separate tumor nodules in the same lobe, but without invasion into the visceral pleura or other structures.
   - pN0 indicates no regional lymph node metastasis.
   - pM not applicable suggests no distant metastasis was assessed or identified.

4. **AJCC Staging**:
   - According to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system, Stage IIB is consistent with a pT3, pN0, M0 classification, where the tumor is large or has multiple nodules in the same lobe but without lymph node involvement or distant metastasis.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
32,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging the lung cancer according to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) guidelines:

1. **Primary Tumor (T):** The tumor is described as T2, which indicates a tumor greater than 3 cm in greatest dimension. This is consistent with a T2 classification.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):** The report indicates N1, which means there are metastases in ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes. Specifically, one out of two examined lymph nodes is involved.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** The report states MX, which means distant metastasis cannot be assessed. However, there is no indication of distant metastasis being present.

Based on the TNM classification:
- T2 indicates a tumor size greater than 3 cm.
- N1 indicates regional lymph node involvement.
- MX suggests that distant metastasis is not assessed, but there is no evidence of distant metastasis.

According to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer:
- Stage I typically involves T1 or T2 tumors with N0 (no regional lymph node involvement).
- Stage II involves T1 or T2 tumors with N1 (regional lymph node involvement).
- Stage III involves more extensive lymph node involvement (N2 or N3) or larger tumors (T3 or T4).
- Stage IV involves distant metastasis (M1).

Given the T2N1MX classification, the cancer is consistent with Stage II, as there is no evidence of distant metastasis and there is involvement of ipsilateral lymph nodes.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
33,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information:

1. **Primary Tumor (pT):** The adenocarcinoma measures 2.5 cm in greatest dimension. There is a suggestion of visceral pleural invasion, but it is not definitively confirmed. The tumor margins are uninvolved, and there is no direct extension, venous, arterial, or lymphatic invasion identified.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN):** The report indicates that there is no evidence of metastasis in the lymph nodes examined. Specifically, level 12 lymph nodes show no evidence of metastasis in four nodes, level 7 lymph nodes show no evidence of metastasis in seven nodes, and level 11 lymph nodes show no evidence of metastasis in three nodes. Level 9 lymph nodes were not identified.

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM):** The distant metastasis cannot be evaluated by this specimen (pMX).

Based on the AJCC staging system for lung cancer:

- **T1:** Tumor ≤3 cm in greatest dimension, surrounded by lung or visceral pleura, without bronchoscopic evidence of invasion more proximal than the lobar bronchus.
- **N0:** No regional lymph node metastasis.
- **M0:** No distant metastasis (though pMX is noted, we assume no clinical evidence of metastasis).

Given the tumor size (2.5 cm) and the absence of confirmed lymph node involvement or distant metastasis, the cancer would be classified as Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
34,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to consider the TNM classification provided in the pathology report:

1. **Primary Tumor (pT):** The tumor is described as measuring 3.5 cm in maximum dimension and is limited to the lung parenchyma but invades into the pleura. This is classified as pT2. According to AJCC, pT2 indicates a tumor that is more than 3 cm but 5 cm or less, or a tumor that involves the main bronchus, invades visceral pleura, or is associated with atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN):** The report states pNX, which means that the regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed. In the absence of lymph node involvement information, we assume no lymph node metastasis for staging purposes.

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM):** The report states pMX, indicating that distant metastasis cannot be assessed. In the absence of information, we assume no distant metastasis for staging purposes.

Given the information:
- pT2 (tumor size and pleural invasion)
- pNX (lymph nodes not assessed, assume N0)
- pMX (distant metastasis not assessed, assume M0)

Based on the AJCC staging system for lung cancer:
- Stage I: T1-2, N0, M0
- Stage II: T2b, N0, M0 or T1-2, N1, M0
- Stage III: T1-2, N2, M0 or T3, N0-1, M0
- Stage IV: Any T, Any N, M1

Since the tumor is pT2, and assuming N0 and M0 due to lack of information, the cancer would be classified as Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
35,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information:

1. **Tumor Size and Invasion**: The tumor is 2.8 cm in size and is described as an invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with angiolymphatic and visceral pleural invasion.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: All sampled lymph nodes are benign, indicating no regional lymph node metastasis (N0).

3. **Metastasis**: The report states ""MX,"" which means distant metastasis cannot be assessed, but there is no indication of distant metastasis in the report.

4. **Pathologic Stage**: The report explicitly states the pathologic stage as T2N0MX.

According to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for lung cancer:

- **T2**: Tumor size is more than 3 cm but 5 cm or less, or tumor involves the main bronchus, invades visceral pleura, or is associated with atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis that extends to the hilar region but does not involve the entire lung.
- **N0**: No regional lymph node metastasis.
- **MX**: Distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Based on the T2N0MX classification, the cancer is classified as Stage II. However, since the tumor size is 2.8 cm, which is less than 3 cm, it should be considered T1, which would make it Stage I. The visceral pleural invasion does not change the T classification to T2 unless the size criteria are met.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
36,"## Answer
The pathology report provides several key pieces of information that are relevant for staging the cancer according to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) guidelines:

1. **Tumor Size and Location**: The tumor is located in the middle lobe of the right lung and measures 5.5 x 5.0 cm. This size is significant for staging purposes.

2. **Histologic Type and Grade**: The tumor is a non-small cell carcinoma, poorly differentiated (G3).

3. **Visceral Pleural Invasion**: There is no visceral pleural invasion, which is an important factor in staging lung cancer.

4. **Tumor Extension**: The tumor extends into the fissure, which may indicate local extension but not necessarily invasion into other structures.

5. **Margins**: The bronchial margin is negative for tumor, and there is no squamous cell carcinoma in situ identified. Vascular, parenchymal, and pleural margins are all negative for carcinoma.

6. **Lymph Nodes**: Twelve lymph nodes were examined, and they are negative for carcinoma. This suggests no regional lymph node involvement (N0).

7. **Distant Metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis (M0).

Based on the information provided:
- The tumor size (5.5 cm) and extension into the fissure suggest a T2 classification.
- The absence of lymph node involvement (N0) and no distant metastasis (M0) are crucial for staging.

According to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer:
- T2, N0, M0 corresponds to Stage IIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
37,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the lung cancer from the pathology report, we need to consider the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and metastasis.

1. **Tumor Size (T):** The report indicates a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with clear cell changes measuring 7 cm in the right lung. According to AJCC staging, a tumor greater than 5 cm but less than or equal to 7 cm is classified as T2b.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N):** The report states that there is no tumor seen in multiple lymph nodes examined, including mediastinal, right level 4, level 7, and peribronchial lymph nodes. This indicates N0, meaning no regional lymph node metastasis.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so we assume M0, meaning no distant metastasis.

Based on the above information:
- T2b (tumor size > 5 cm but ≤ 7 cm)
- N0 (no regional lymph node involvement)
- M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging for lung cancer, a T2bN0M0 classification corresponds to Stage IIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
38,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to consider the primary tumor size, lymph node involvement, and the presence of metastasis.

1. **Primary Tumor (T):** The report states ""PRIMARY TUMOR: pT2a: Tumor more than 3 cm but 5 cm or less."" According to AJCC staging, a pT2a tumor is classified as a tumor more than 3 cm but 5 cm or less in greatest dimension.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):** The report indicates ""REGIONAL LYMPH NODES: pN1: Metastasis in ipsilateral peribronchial lymph nodes."" This means there is metastasis in the lymph nodes on the same side as the primary tumor, which corresponds to N1.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, which implies M0 (no distant metastasis).

Based on the TNM classification:
- T2a
- N1
- M0

According to the AJCC 7th Edition staging system for lung cancer:
- T2a, N1, M0 corresponds to Stage IIB.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
