Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor (pT) is classified as pT3, which means the tumor is larger than 5 cm or has invaded the mediastinum or involves the visceral pleura.
2. The regional lymph nodes (pN) are classified as pN1, which means there is metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes.
3. The metastasis (pM) is classified as pMX, which means distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Based on the pT3 and pN1 classifications, the AJCC stage is Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
1,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions a 1.1 cm moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in the lung, which is T1a according to the AJCC 8th edition staging system (tumors ≤ 1 cm in size).

2. The tumor has invaded the overlying pleura, which is classified as PL1 (tumor invades visceral pleura). This does not affect the T stage.

3. There is no lymphovascular invasion mentioned in the report.

4. The report mentions that the margin of resection is negative for carcinoma, indicating that the tumor has been completely resected (R0 resection).

5. The report also mentions that a segment of the 6th rib was resected and was negative for carcinoma, indicating that there is no bone involvement.

6. There is no mention of lymph node involvement or distant metastases in the report.

Based on these findings, the tumor can be staged as follows:

* T stage: T1a (tumor ≤ 1 cm in size)
* N stage: N0 (no lymph node involvement)
* M stage: M0 (no distant metastases)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T1a, N0, M0 tumor corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
2,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor (T) is described as a 27 mm poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma in the right upper lobe, with focal blood vessel and perineural invasion, but no lymphatic permeation. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, this corresponds to a T1 tumor (since it is ≤ 3 cm in size).

2. The report mentions hilar lymph node metastases, which indicates that the cancer has spread to the regional lymph nodes. This corresponds to an N1 designation (since the cancer has spread to the hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes, but not to the supraclavicular lymph nodes).

3. There is no mention of distant metastases in the report, so the M designation is MX (cannot be assessed).

Based on the T1N1MX designations, we can determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T1N1MX corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
3,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions a ""GRADE II-III SQUAMOUS CARCINOMA OF THE LUNG"" in the left lung, which indicates the primary tumor (T).
2. The tumor involves the pleura, but the vascular and bronchial margins of resection are negative, suggesting that the tumor has not invaded the blood vessels or bronchi.
3. The tumor has focally extended to the inked pleural margin, which implies that the tumor has invaded the visceral pleura (PL1). According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, this corresponds to a T2a tumor.
4. The report mentions that multiple lymph nodes were examined, but none of them showed tumor involvement (N0).
5. Since the tumor has not invaded the blood vessels or bronchi, and there is no lymph node involvement, the tumor is confined to the lung and pleura.

Based on these findings, the AJCC stage of the cancer is:

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IIA""}"
4,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (T)**: The tumor is described as an exophytic invasive moderately to poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, measuring 3.7 x 2.8 x 2.8 cm. Since the tumor is larger than 3 cm, it falls into the T2 category.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N)**: The report indicates that one out of ten peribronchial lymph nodes is positive for metastasis (N1). This suggests that the cancer has spread to the ipsilateral hilar and/or peribronchial lymph nodes.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: There is no evidence of distant metastasis (M0).

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* T2 (primary tumor size > 3 cm)
* N1 (ipsilateral hilar and/or peribronchial lymph node involvement)
* M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC staging system, a T2N1M0 corresponds to **Stage IIA**. However, since the options provided do not include Stage IIA, we need to consider the closest match. Between Stage II and Stage III, Stage II is a better fit, as it also includes T2N1M0.

Therefore, the answer is -
{""stage"" : Stage II}"
5,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor type is squamous cell carcinoma, and the histologic grade is moderately differentiated.
2. The tumor size is 2.4 cm, which corresponds to T1b (tumor size > 2 cm but ≤ 3 cm).
3. The surgical margins are free of tumor, and there is no direct extension of the tumor.
4. Lymphatic and venous invasions are absent.
5. A total of 7 lymph nodes were examined, and none of them were involved with cancer (pNO).
6. The tumor approaches but does not involve the visceral pleura.

Based on these findings, the TNM staging is pT1b, pNO, and pMX (metastasis cannot be assessed).

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a tumor with T1b and N0 staging corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
6,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor (pT) is classified as pT2a, which means the tumor is > 3 cm and < 5 cm in greatest dimension, surrounded by lung or visceral pleura, without bronchoscopic evidence of invasion in the main bronchus.
2. The regional lymph nodes (pN) are classified as pNO, which means there is no regional lymph node metastasis.
3. There is no mention of distant metastasis (pM) in the report.

Based on the TNM classification, the patient's cancer can be staged as follows:

* Tumor (T): T2a (primary tumor is > 3 cm and < 5 cm in greatest dimension)
* Node (N): N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis)
* Metastasis (M): M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a patient with a T2a, N0, M0 classification corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is -

7,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumour size is 45 mm in diameter, which corresponds to T2a (tumour > 3 cm but ≤ 5 cm).
2. The tumour abuts the visceral pleura, but there is no pleural invasion.
3. The tumour is clear of the bronchial resection margin, with no lymphatic, vascular, or perineural invasion present.
4. The peribronchial lymph nodes, left hilar lymph node, and mediastinal lymph node are not involved by tumour, indicating N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis).

Based on the TNM classification, the patient has a T2a N0 tumour. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2a N0 tumour corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
8,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions a primary tumor in the right lower lobe of the lung, measuring 5 x 4.5 x 2.6 cm, which is a significant size. However, it does not extend through the pleura, which suggests that the tumor is still localized within the lung.

2. The bronchial margin is negative for tumor, indicating that the tumor has not invaded the bronchus.

3. Multiple intrapulmonary peribronchial lymph nodes are negative for tumor, which suggests that the tumor has not spread to the regional lymph nodes within the lung.

4. The report also mentions that multiple superior and inferior mediastinal lymph nodes, as well as N1 lymph nodes, are negative for tumor. This indicates that the tumor has not spread to the mediastinal lymph nodes or the N1 lymph nodes.

Based on these findings, we can conclude that the tumor is localized within the lung, has not invaded the bronchus, and has not spread to the regional lymph nodes. This corresponds to the T2 category (tumor > 4 cm in greatest dimension) and N0 category (no regional lymph node metastasis).

According to the AJCC staging system, a T2N0 tumor corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
9,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the left upper lobe of the lung, and its greatest diameter is 3.2 cm, which corresponds to a T2 tumor (T1: ≤ 3 cm, T2: > 3 cm but ≤ 5 cm, T3: > 5 cm but ≤ 7 cm, T4: > 7 cm).
2. The tumor involves the visceral pleura, but there is no vascular invasion, perineural invasion, or bronchial margin involvement.
3. The lymph node status is as follows: peribronchial lymph nodes are 0/8, indicating no metastasis to these nodes.
4. However, the mediastinal lymph nodes (levels 5, 6, 7, and 11) are all benign, with no evidence of metastasis.

Based on the above information, we can determine the N stage as N0, since there is no metastasis to the lymph nodes.

Combining the T and N stages, we get a stage of T2N0. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2N0 tumor corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is -

10,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Primary tumor (pT): The report states that the primary tumor is pT1b, which means the tumor is 2 cm or less in size and has not invaded the visceral pleura.

2. Regional lymph nodes (pN): The report states that the regional lymph nodes, including the hilar and peribronchial lymph nodes, are negative for tumor, which corresponds to pN0.

3. Distant metastasis (pM): The report does not mention any distant metastases, so pM is not applicable.

Based on the pT1b and pN0, the AJCC stage of the cancer is Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
11,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary tumor (T stage)**: The report states that the tumor is an invasive squamous cell carcinoma, 4.5 cm in diameter, with visceral pleural and angiolymphatic invasion. This corresponds to a T4 stage, as the tumor has invaded the visceral pleura.

2. **Lymph node involvement (N stage)**: The report mentions that one out of 12 N1 lymph nodes is positive for metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. This corresponds to an N1 stage, as there is involvement of ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes.

3. **Distant metastasis (M stage)**: The report does not mention any distant metastases, so the M stage is MX (cannot be assessed).

Based on the T4N1MX staging, the AJCC stage of the cancer is **Stage III**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
12,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions a 2.3 x 2 x 1.8 cm mass in the left upper lobe of the lung, which is a primary tumor (T). Since it abuts but does not directly invade the pleura, we can classify it as T2a (tumor 2-3 cm in greatest dimension).

2. The report does not mention any distant metastases (M), so we can assume M0 (no distant metastases).

3. The report mentions that multiple lymph nodes were excised, including inferior mediastinal, aortic, and N1 lymph nodes. However, all of these lymph nodes were negative for tumor, indicating that there is no nodal involvement (N0).

4. Based on the TNM classification, a T2a primary tumor with N0 nodal involvement and M0 distant metastases corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
13,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the left lung, and it measures 2.5 cm in greatest dimension, which corresponds to a T2 tumor (PT2).
2. The pleura, bronchial, and vascular margins are negative for tumor, indicating that the tumor has not invaded these structures.
3. The peribronchial lymph nodes are negative for tumor (0/9), indicating that there is no nodal involvement in the lung (N0).
4. The tumor has involved the left main bronchus, but there is no evidence of distant metastases.
5. The lymph nodes in the inferior pulmonary vein, level 5, level 7, and level 9 are all negative for tumor, indicating that there is no nodal involvement in these stations.

Based on the above findings, the tumor can be staged as follows:

* T2 (primary tumor size 2.5 cm)
* N0 (no nodal involvement)
* M0 (no distant metastases)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2N0M0 tumor corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
14,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to analyze the pathology report and identify the key components that contribute to the staging.

First, we look at the Pathological T (pT) stage, which is T2a. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual, a T2a tumor is defined as a tumor that is >2 cm but ≤3 cm in greatest dimension.

Next, we examine the Pathological N (pN) stage, which is N1. This indicates that there is metastasis to 1-3 lymph nodes.

The Clinical M (cM) stage is M0, indicating that there is no distant metastasis.

Now, we can use the TNM staging system to determine the overall stage. Based on the pT2a and pN1 stages, the patient has a Stage III cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
15,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The specimen type is a lobectomy, which means the entire lung lobe was removed. This suggests that the tumor is localized to the lung.

2. The tumor size is 3 X 3 X 3.5 cm, which is a significant size but does not provide direct information about the stage.

3. The histologic type is squamous cell carcinoma, which is a type of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The histologic grade is moderately differentiated, but this does not affect the staging.

4. The tumor extent is not specified, which means we cannot determine if the tumor has invaded nearby structures or not.

5. There is no information about lymph nodes, lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, or margins, which are important factors in determining the stage.

Given the limited information, we can only conclude that the tumor is localized to the lung (based on the lobectomy specimen) and has a significant size (3 X 3 X 3.5 cm). However, without information about lymph node involvement, invasion, or metastasis, we cannot determine the exact stage.

Based on the available information, the most likely stage is Stage I, as the tumor appears to be localized to the lung. However, this is an incomplete staging due to the lack of information about lymph nodes and other factors.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
16,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (T)**: The tumor size is 4.2 x 4.0 x 2.3 cm, which corresponds to T2a (tumor > 3 cm but ≤ 5 cm in greatest dimension).
2. **Visceral Pleural Invasion (VPI)**: The report mentions ""Visceral pleural invasion: Present,"" which is a key factor in determining the T stage. With VPI, the tumor is upstaged to T2a.
3. **Lymph Node Status (N)**: Only one peribronchial node was received, and it did not contain metastatic carcinoma, so the N stage is NO (no regional lymph node metastasis).
4. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so the M stage is M0 (no distant metastasis).

Based on the TNM staging system, the patient's cancer stage is:

T2a (primary tumor) + NO (lymph node status) + M0 (distant metastasis) = Stage II

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"

2. **Lymph nodes (N)**: One of the 12 N1 lymph nodes is positive for metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, which corresponds to an N1 stage (metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes).
3. **Distant metastasis (M)**: There is no evidence of distant metastasis, so the M stage is MX (cannot be assessed).

Based on the TNM staging system, the patient's cancer is classified as Stage IIA (T2 N1 MX).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IIA}"
18,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions ""Squamous cell carcinoma"" as the histological description, which indicates the type of cancer.

2. The TNM Stage is mentioned as T2, N2, M0.

3. According to the AJCC staging system, T2 indicates a tumor larger than 3 cm but not larger than 5 cm, or a tumor that is partially obstructing the airway.

4. N2 indicates that the cancer has spread to ipsilateral mediastinal or subcarinal lymph nodes.

5. M0 indicates that there is no distant metastasis.

6. Based on the TNM Stage, we can determine the overall AJCC Stage. For a T2, N2, M0, the corresponding AJCC Stage is Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
19,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

First, we need to identify the T, N, and M stages from the report.

The T stage is determined by the size of the tumor and its invasion into surrounding structures. In this case, the tumor is 57 mm in greatest dimension, which corresponds to a T3 stage (T3: Tumor > 5 cm in greatest dimension). Additionally, the tumor invades the pericardium, which is also consistent with a T3 stage.

The N stage is determined by the presence or absence of lymph node metastases. According to the report, there is no evidence of metastatic carcinoma in the hilar lymph node, which corresponds to an N0 stage (N0: No regional lymph node metastases).

The M stage is determined by the presence or absence of distant metastases. There is no mention of distant metastases in the report, which suggests an M0 stage (M0: No distant metastases).

Now, we can determine the overall stage of the cancer based on the T, N, and M stages. According to the AJCC staging system, a T3N0M0 corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
20,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor (T) is described as a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, 52 mm in diameter, with invasion of the parietal pleura (T3).
2. The tumor has extensive vascular invasion and focal perineural invasion, but no lymphatic invasion.
3. The soft tissue resection margin is clear of malignancy, and the upper lobe resection margin is also clear.
4. The lymph node sampling reveals metastatic carcinoma in one of the lymph nodes (No. 11 lymph node), which corresponds to N1.

Based on the TNM classification, the patient has a T3 primary tumor, N1 lymph node involvement, and no distant metastases (M0). According to the AJCC staging system, this corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
21,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the primary tumor (T), lymph nodes (N), and distant metastasis (M).

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The primary tumor (T) is classified as pT3, which means the tumor is larger than 5 cm or invades the chest wall (as mentioned in the report).
* The lymph nodes (N) are classified as pNO, which means no regional lymph node metastasis is found.
* There is no mention of distant metastasis (M) in the report.

Based on the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a pT3 classification and no lymph node involvement (pNO) would correspond to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
22,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to analyze the pathology report and identify the key features that determine the stage.

From the report, we can see that the tumor is a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with a diameter of 5.0 cm, which corresponds to a T2 tumor size (T2: tumor >3 cm but ≤5 cm).

The report also mentions that there is no evidence of visceral pleural or angiolymphatic invasion, which suggests that the tumor has not invaded the visceral pleura or lymphatic vessels.

Regarding lymph node involvement, the report states that one of fifteen N1 lymph nodes is positive for metastases, which corresponds to an N1 nodal status (N1: metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes).

There is no evidence of metastases in the N2 lymph nodes, and no distant metastases are mentioned in the report, which suggests that the M status is MX (MX: distant metastasis cannot be assessed).

Based on the T2N1MX classification, we can determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2N1MX tumor corresponds to Stage IIA.

Therefore, the answer is -
{""stage"" : Stage IIA}"
23,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the left lung, and it measures 11.0 cm in its greatest dimension. This corresponds to a T2 tumor, as it is larger than 5 cm but not more than 10 cm.
2. The visceral pleural, bronchial, and vascular margins are negative for tumor, indicating that the tumor has not invaded these structures.
3. One out of twelve peribronchial lymph nodes is positive for metastatic carcinoma, which corresponds to N1 disease (metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial and/or hilar lymph nodes).
4. There is no evidence of distant metastasis (M0) in the report.

According to the AJCC staging system, a T2 tumor with N1 disease and M0 corresponds to Stage IIA.

However, the report also mentions that one of the level 10 lymph nodes is positive for microscopic metastatic carcinoma, which is a contralateral mediastinal lymph node (N3 disease). This upstages the tumor to Stage IIIB.

Therefore, the answer is -
{""stage"" : Stage IIIB}"
24,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the Cancer:

1. **Tumor size**: The tumor size is 3 x 2 x 2 cm, which is a relatively small size. This suggests that the primary tumor (T) is likely to be T1 or T2, as T3 tumors are typically larger than 5 cm.

2. **Lymph nodes**: The report states that 3 out of 6 lymph nodes are positive for metastasis, which indicates that the cancer has spread to the regional lymph nodes. This corresponds to N2, as N2 is defined as metastasis to ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes.

3. **Distant metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, which suggests that M0 (no distant metastasis) is the correct classification.

4. **AJCC Stage**: Based on the T, N, and M classifications, we can determine the AJCC Stage. With a T1 or T2 primary tumor, N2 regional lymph node involvement, and no distant metastasis (M0), the AJCC Stage is likely to be Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
25,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the cancer:

1. **Tumor size**: The tumor size is 8 x 8 x 8 cm, which is a significant size, but it doesn't directly determine the stage.

2. **Tumor extent**: The tumor has invaded the visceral pleura, which indicates a T2 or higher classification (T2: tumor invades visceral pleura).

3. **Lymph nodes**: 8 out of 10 lymph nodes are positive for metastasis, which is a significant number. This indicates an N2 classification (N2: metastasis to ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes).

4. **Distant metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report.

Considering the above factors, we can determine the TNM classification as follows:

* T: T2 (tumor invades visceral pleura)
* N: N2 (metastasis to ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes)
* M: M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2N2M0 classification corresponds to **Stage III**.

27,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor is a squamous cell carcinoma, moderately differentiated, with a maximal tumor size of 7.7 cm. This corresponds to a T2 tumor, as it is greater than 3 cm in greatest dimension.
2. The visceral pleura is invaded, which is also consistent with a T2 tumor.
3. There is no regional lymph node metastasis, as all peribronchial lymph nodes (6 lobar and 1 segmental) are negative for malignancy. This corresponds to an N0 node status.
4. There is no mention of distant metastasis, so the M status is M0.

Based on the TNM staging system, a T2N0M0 tumor corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
28,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the left upper lobe of the lung, measuring 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm, and is 1.8 cm away from the bronchial margin, which is negative for tumor. This suggests that the tumor is confined to the lung and has not invaded the bronchial margin.

2. The report mentions that multiple (10) intrapulmonary peribronchial lymph nodes are positive for tumor, which indicates lymph node involvement.

3. The visceral pleura is also involved, which suggests that the tumor has invaded the pleura.

4. The report also mentions that multiple lymph nodes in the superior mediastinal, aortic, inferior mediastinal, and left lower lobe bronchus regions are negative for tumor.

Considering the above points, we can determine the T, N, and M stages as follows:

* T stage: The tumor is 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm in size and has invaded the visceral pleura, which corresponds to a T2b stage (tumor > 2 cm in greatest dimension and invades the visceral pleura).
* N stage: The presence of tumor in multiple intrapulmonary peribronchial lymph nodes corresponds to an N1 stage (metastasis to intrapulmonary nodes).
* M stage: There is no evidence of distant metastasis, so the M stage is M0.

Based on the T, N, and M stages, we can determine the overall AJCC stage. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2bN1M0 stage corresponds to Stage IIA.

However, since the options provided do not include Stage IIA, we need to consider the closest match. Given that the tumor has invaded the visceral pleura and has lymph node involvement, the closest match would be Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
29,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor (T) is described as a 4.5 cm poorly differentiated basaloid type squamous cell carcinoma that invades the visceral pleura but not the pericardium. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, this corresponds to a T2 tumor (tumor > 3 cm but ≤ 5 cm in greatest dimension).

2. The regional lymph nodes (N) are negative for tumor involvement, with 7 lymph nodes examined and none involved. This corresponds to an N0 designation.

3. There is no mention of distant metastases (M) in the pathology report, so we can assume that the M designation is MX (cannot be assessed) or M0 (no distant metastases).

4. Based on the T, N, and M designations, we can determine the overall stage of the cancer. With a T2 tumor, N0 lymph nodes, and no distant metastases, the AJCC stage is Stage IIA.

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Primary tumor (pT): The report mentions two lesions, 2.6 cm and 4 cm in greatest dimension, with visceral pleural invasion in the smaller lesion. According to the new guidelines, two nodules of similar histology in the same lobe would be classified as pT3.

2. Regional lymph nodes (pN): The report states that there is metastatic carcinoma in one of three hilar lymph nodes, which corresponds to pN1.

3. Distant metastasis (pM): The report indicates pMX, meaning that distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

2. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a tumor size of 3 cm or less corresponds to a T1 stage.
3. There is no mention of lymph node involvement or distant metastases in the report, which suggests that the N (lymph node) and M (metastasis) stages are likely N0 and M0, respectively.
4. Since the report does not provide information on lymph node involvement or distant metastases, we cannot rule out the possibility of N1, N2, or M1 stages. However, based on the available information, it is reasonable to assume that the N and M stages are likely N0 and M0.
5. Combining the T1 stage with the assumed N0 and M0 stages, we can determine the overall stage of the cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
32,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (T)**: The tumor size is 4.0 cm, which corresponds to pT2 (tumor with any of the following features of size or extent: greater than 3 cm in greatest dimension).
2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N)**: One lobar lymph node out of nine lymph nodes is positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma (pN1: Metastasis in ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes, including intrapulmonary nodes involved by direct extension of the primary tumor).
3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so pMX (cannot be assessed) is assumed.

Based on the pT2 and pN1 classifications, the patient's cancer is at **Stage II**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
33,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (pT)**: The report states that the tumor measures 4.9 cm in maximum dimension, which corresponds to pT2a (Tumor > 3 cm, and < 5 cm in greatest dimension surrounded by lung or visceral pleura, without bronchoscopic evidence of invasion in the main bronchus).

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN)**: The report indicates that multiple lymph nodes were excised and examined, but none of them showed malignancy (0/6). This corresponds to pN0 (No regional lymph node metastasis).

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM)**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so pM is not applicable.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

**AJCC Stage**: The combination of pT2a and pN0 corresponds to Stage II (T2a, N0, M0).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
34,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary tumor (pT)**: The tumor measures 5.5 cm in dimension and extends through the pleura but is not identified at the outer surface of the specimen. This corresponds to a T2b tumor (tumor > 5 cm in greatest dimension).
2. **Margins of resection**: The margins are negative for tumor.
3. **Direct extension of tumor**: The tumor extends into the pleura, which shows a desmoplastic response to tumor.
4. **Vessel invasion**: Not identified.
5. **Regional lymph nodes (pN)**: pNO, meaning no regional lymph node metastases are identified.
6. **Distant metastasis (pM)**: pMx, meaning distant metastases cannot be assessed.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* Tumor (T): T2b (tumor > 5 cm in greatest dimension)
* Node (N): N0 (no regional lymph node metastases)
* Metastasis (M): Mx (distant metastases cannot be assessed)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2bN0Mx tumor corresponds to **Stage II**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
35,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to analyze the pathology report and identify the key factors that affect staging.

First, we need to identify the primary tumor (T) stage. The report states that the tumor size is 4.9 x 4.7 x 4.5 cm, which corresponds to a T3 stage (tumor > 5 cm in greatest dimension).

Next, we need to determine the nodal (N) stage. The report states that the lobar lymph nodes are negative for carcinoma, which corresponds to an N0 stage (no regional lymph node metastases).

Finally, we need to determine the metastasis (M) stage. There is no evidence of distant metastases in the report, which corresponds to an M0 stage (no distant metastases).

Based on the TNM classification, the pathologic stage is pT3 pNO PL3, which corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
36,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer:

1. The primary tumor (T) is described as a 4.5 x 4 x 3 cm intrabronchial and parenchymal hilar mass, which is a significant size. However, there is no mention of invasion into the pleura or chest wall, so it's likely a T2 or T3.

2. The report mentions that the tumor extends to within a few millimeters of the bronchial margin, which is involved by extensive in situ carcinoma. This suggests that the tumor has not invaded the bronchial margin, which is a key factor in determining the T stage.

3. The lymph node involvement is extensive, with metastases in multiple intrapulmonary peribronchial lymph nodes (6 of 14), aortopulmonary lymph nodes (2 of 2), and anterior mediastinal lymph nodes (1 of 2). This indicates a high level of nodal involvement, likely N3.

4. There is no mention of distant metastases (M) in the report.

Based on these findings, the TNM staging would be T2 or T3, N3, M0. According to the AJCC staging system, this corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
37,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the right lower lobe, and it measures 3.5 cm in greatest dimension. This corresponds to a T2a tumor (since it's >3 cm but ≤5 cm).
2. The tumor is predominantly endobronchial but with pulmonary parenchymal invasion. This does not affect the T stage.
3. The closest inked pleural margin is negative for malignancy, and the bronchus and blood vessels at the surgical margin are also negative for malignancy. This indicates that there is no pleural or vascular invasion.
4. There is no lymphovascular invasion mentioned in the report.
5. The lymph nodes examined from various stations (anterior lobular, subcarinal, right hilum, right lower peritracheal area) are all benign and anthracotic, with no evidence of malignancy. This indicates that there is no nodal involvement (N0).

Based on the above information, the TNM classification would be T2a, N0, and M0 (since there is no mention of distant metastases). According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, this corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
38,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the right lower lobe lung, measuring 2.9 x 2.5 x 1.8 cm.
2. The tumor extends subpleurally but not to the pleural surface, which suggests a T2a tumor (since it's larger than 2 cm but not more than 3 cm in greatest dimension, and it doesn't invade the visceral pleura).
3. There is no vascular invasion or perineural invasion identified.
4. The bronchial margin is free of tumor.
5. The lymph node status is as follows: all lymph nodes examined (Level VII mediastinal, Level VII mediastinal #2, Right mediastinal lymph node level XI) are benign, with no metastatic nodes identified. This suggests an N0 lymph node status.
6. There is no evidence of distant metastasis (M0) in the report.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* Tumor (T): T2a (since the tumor is larger than 2 cm but not more than 3 cm in greatest dimension, and it doesn't invade the visceral pleura)
* Node (N): N0 (since all lymph nodes examined are benign with no metastatic nodes identified)
* Metastasis (M): M0 (since there is no evidence of distant metastasis)

Therefore, the AJCC stage is Stage I (T2a, N0, M0).

Therefore, the answer is -

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary diagnosis is a large, intermediate to peripheral bronchopulmonary, histologically poorly differentiated, large-cell and polymorphocellular nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma of the right lower lobe of the lung.
2. The TNM classification is provided as pT2 pNO pMX R0, which indicates:
   - pT2: The primary tumor is larger than 3 cm but not more than 5 cm in greatest dimension, or the tumor is more than 5 cm in greatest dimension but does not invade the visceral pleura (in this case, the tumor is 8.5 cm in size, but it does not invade the visceral pleura).
   - pNO: No regional lymph node metastases are present.
   - pMX: Distant metastases cannot be assessed.
   - R0: The surgical margins are tumor-free.
3. Based on the TNM classification, the stage is determined as Stage IB.

{""stage"" : ""Stage IB""}"
40,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions that the tumor is staged as pT3 due to the presence of separate tumor nodules in the same lobe, away from the main central tumor.
2. The tumor size is reported as 5.5 cm x 4.0 cm x 3.5 cm, which is greater than 7 cm in greatest dimension, making it a T3 tumor.
3. There is no evidence of chest wall invasion, diaphragmatic invasion, or mediastinal pleura invasion, which would have upgraded the T stage.
4. The report states that all margins are negative for invasive carcinoma, including the bronchial margin, vascular margin, and parenchymal margin.
5. There is no evidence of lymphovascular invasion or extranodal extension.
6. The report mentions that 8 lymph nodes were examined, and none of them showed metastatic carcinoma, making it pN0.
7. There is no mention of distant metastasis, making it pM0.

Based on the above information, the TNM staging is pT3N0M0.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a pT3N0M0 tumor corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is -
{""stage"" : Stage II}"
41,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Tumor size**: The tumor size is 6.5 x 5.5 x 5.5 cm, which is a significant size, but it doesn't directly determine the stage.

2. **Tumor extent**: The tumor extent is not specified, which means we can't determine if the tumor has invaded nearby structures or not.

3. **Lymph nodes**: 0/6 lymph nodes are positive for metastasis, which means there is no lymph node involvement.

4. **Distant metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report.

Based on the above information, we can conclude that the tumor is large (T3) but has not invaded nearby structures (no information) and has no lymph node involvement (N0). Since there is no mention of distant metastasis, we can assume M0.

According to the AJCC staging system, a T3N0M0 tumor corresponds to **Stage II**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
42,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can see that the tumor is located in the left upper lobe of the lung and has invaded the chest wall and ribs (part of serratus muscle, second rib, and intercostal muscle between ribs 1 and 2). The tumor size is 4.5 cm in greatest dimension.

There is no lymph node involvement, as all the lymph nodes excised (levels 7, 8, 9, 11-L, 5, and 6) are negative for malignancy.

There is no evidence of distant metastasis, as the pleura and other soft tissue biopsies are negative for malignancy.

According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a size of 4.5 cm and invasion of the chest wall (T3) and no lymph node involvement (N0) and no distant metastasis (M0) corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
46,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The tumor size is 5.0 cm, which corresponds to T2 (tumor > 3 cm but ≤ 5 cm).
* The lymph node status is as follows: Peribronchial - 6/9; Parenchymal - 1/1, which indicates that there are metastases in the regional lymph nodes. This corresponds to N2 (metastases in ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes).
* There is no evidence of distant metastasis (M0).

According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a size of T2, lymph node involvement of N2, and no distant metastasis (M0) corresponds to Stage IIIA.

Therefore, the answer is:

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary diagnosis is a large-cell, polymorphocellular, and partly gigantocellular, barely keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma in the upper lobe of the left lung, with localization in the boundary region of segments 1-3.
2. The tumor size is approximately 9 cm, which corresponds to T2 (tumor > 5 cm but ≤ 7 cm).
3. The tumor extends to the pleura in the region of adhesion, but there is no evidence of visceral pleura infiltration. This corresponds to PL1 (tumor invades visceral pleura).
4. The tumor also extends to the medial pleura over S2, with a pleural defect. This further supports the PL1 classification.
5. The bronchus resection margin is tumor-free, indicating R0 resection.
6. The lymph nodes examined (stations 10, 11, 12, 5, 6, and 7) show evidence of tumor involvement, with multiple lesioned grayish-black nodes or node parts.

Considering the above findings, we can determine the TNM classification as follows:

* T: T2 (tumor > 5 cm but ≤ 7 cm)
* N: N2 (tumor involves ipsilateral mediastinal or subcarinal lymph nodes)
* M: M0 (no distant metastases)
* PL: PL1 (tumor invades visceral pleura)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, the corresponding stage is Stage III.

49,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions that the carcinoma involves the pleural surface, which indicates that the tumor has invaded the visceral pleura (T2).

2. All surgical margins of resection are negative for tumor, which means there is no evidence of tumor at the resection margins (R0).

3. The report also mentions that one hila lymph node and associated fibroadipose tissue are negative for tumor, as well as lymph nodes at stations 5 and 11. This indicates that there is no nodal involvement (N0).

4. Since there is no mention of distant metastases, we can assume that there is no evidence of metastatic disease (M0).

Based on the TNM classification, the patient has a T2 tumor (involving the pleural surface), N0 (no nodal involvement), and M0 (no distant metastases). According to the AJCC staging system, this corresponds to Stage II.

50,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions a ""poorly-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma"" with a maximal dimension of 37mm, which corresponds to a T2 tumor (Tumor size > 3 cm but ≤ 5 cm).
2. There is no evidence of pleural invasion, blood vessel invasion, lymphatic permeation, or perineural permeation, which suggests that the tumor has not invaded nearby structures.
3. The bronchial resection margin is clear of the tumor, indicating that the tumor has not spread to the margins.
4. The peribronchial lymph nodes show sinus histiocytosis and contain carbon pigment, but there is no evidence of metastases, which means that the lymph nodes are not involved (N0).
5. There is no mention of distant metastases (Mx), which means that the cancer has not spread to other parts of the body.

Based on these findings, the pathological stage is T2N0Mx.

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor size is 4 X 3 X 3.5 cm, which is larger than 3 cm but not more than 5 cm. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, this corresponds to a T2 tumor.

2. There is no information about tumor extent, lymph nodes, lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, or margins, which are important factors in determining the N and M components of the TNM staging system. However, the absence of information does not necessarily imply that these factors are negative.

3. Since there is no information about lymph node involvement or distant metastases, we cannot determine the N and M components. However, we can infer that the M component is likely M0 (no distant metastases) since there is no mention of metastases in the report.

4. Given the T2 tumor and unknown N and M components, the minimum stage would be Stage II (T2N0M0). However, without more information, we cannot rule out the possibility of lymph node involvement or distant metastases, which would correspond to a higher stage.

2. The tumor does not involve the visceral pleura, and there is no lymphovascular space invasion.
3. The pleural, bronchial, and vascular margins are free of tumor.
4. No metastatic carcinoma is seen in 11 peribronchial lymph nodes (0/11), and no metastatic carcinoma is seen in lymph nodes from levels 4, 7, and 9 (0/1, 0/4, 0/1, and 0/ multiple, respectively).
5. There is no evidence of distant metastasis (Mx).

Based on these findings, the TNM classification is T2N0Mx.

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM)**: Not evaluated (pMX), which means there is no evidence of distant metastasis.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* Tumor size (pT2b) corresponds to Stage II.
* No regional lymph node involvement (pN0) does not change the stage.
* No distant metastasis (pMX) does not change the stage.

55,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

First, we need to identify the T stage, N stage, and M stage from the report.

The T stage is pT2a, which indicates that the tumor is 4.5 cm in size, but has not invaded the visceral pleura or the main bronchus.

The N stage is pNO, which means that there is no evidence of lymph node involvement.

The M stage is not applicable, which implies that there is no distant metastasis.

Now, let's refer to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer. Since the T stage is pT2a and the N stage is pNO, the patient's cancer is classified as Stage I.

2. The tumor size is 3.0 X 3.0 X 3.0 cm, and it extends to the peripheral aspect of the lung.
3. There is no visceral pleural invasion, but findings are suspicious for lymphovascular invasion.
4. The tumor appears confined to the lung, and the distance from the bronchial margin is 2.0 cm, and from the pleural surface is less than 0.1 cm.
5. The lymph node status shows that none of the 2 lymph nodes received contain metastatic carcinoma (0/2).
6. However, the report mentions a revision, stating that upon re-review, a satellite tumor is discovered, which classifies the neoplasm as a stage T3.

Based on the revised classification, the tumor is pT3NO, which corresponds to Stage IIb according to the AJCC 8th edition staging system.

Therefore, the answer is -
