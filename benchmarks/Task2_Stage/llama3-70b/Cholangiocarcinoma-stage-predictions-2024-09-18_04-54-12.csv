Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor is located in the right hepatic lobe, and the tumor size is 6.2 cm in largest dimension (gross measurement).
2. The tumor growth pattern is mass-forming, and vascular invasion is present, with tumor invasion into portal vein branches and into vena cava.
3. Perineural invasion is identified in specimen D.
4. Invasion of liver capsule is present, but the tumor does not invade through the liver capsule.
5. The parenchymal resection margins are positive for carcinoma.
6. The vascular resection margins are negative for carcinoma.
7. One pericystic lymph node is negative for metastatic carcinoma (0/1).

Based on the AJCC staging manual (7th edition), the tumor is classified as pT2a (tumor size > 5 cm) and pNO (no regional lymph node metastasis).

Considering the presence of vascular invasion and positive parenchymal resection margins, the tumor is likely to have a higher stage.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions that the tumor is a cholangiocarcinoma, which is a type of cancer that originates in the bile ducts.
2. The tumor size is reported as 5.1 cm, which is a significant size.
3. The report mentions that the tumor is present at the inked resection margin, which indicates that the tumor is close to the edge of the surgical specimen.
4. The report also mentions that the tumor is present at the non-inked cauterized margin, which suggests that the tumor may have extended beyond the surgical margin.
5. The lymph node status is reported as negative, with only one lymph node examined.
6. The AJCC stage is reported as pT3aN0, which indicates that the tumor is at least 5 cm in size (T3) and has not spread to lymph nodes (N0).

Based on the information provided, the AJCC stage of the cancer is likely Stage III. The tumor is large (T3) and has not spread to lymph nodes (N0), but it is present at the surgical margin, which suggests that it may have extended beyond the liver.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
2,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor (pT) is classified as pT2b, which means multiple tumors with or without vascular invasion.
2. The tumor size is 3.3 cm, and it focally extends to within 0.1 cm of the parenchymal margin of resection.
3. The tumor superficially invades into the adventitia of a large caliber vein in the hepatic parenchyma, but the lumen of the vein is free of carcinoma.
4. The tumor abuts the capsule of the liver.
5. There is no involvement of the bile duct margin, and the vascular margin is uninvolved by invasive carcinoma.
6. The regional lymph nodes (pN) cannot be assessed, as no nodes were examined.
7. There is no distant metastasis (pM).

Based on the above information, the tumor is classified as T2b (multiple tumors with or without vascular invasion) and N0 (regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed). Since there is no distant metastasis, the M category is M0.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, the stage is determined by the T and M categories. In this case, the stage is Stage II (T2b, N0, M0).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
3,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the cancer.

1. The diagnosis is intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, which is a type of liver cancer.
2. The tumor size is 6.8 X 6.6 X 5.8 cm, which is a significant size, but we need to consider other factors to determine the stage.
3. The tumor extends to 0.3 cm from the surgical resection margin, which means it has not invaded the resection margin (R0 resection).
4. There is no mention of lymph node involvement or distant metastasis in the report.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, the tumor size and extension to the resection margin are important factors.

Since the tumor size is greater than 5 cm (T2), and it has not invaded the resection margin, the primary tumor (T) is classified as T2.

There is no evidence of lymph node involvement (N0) or distant metastasis (M0).

Therefore, the stage is determined by the T category, which is T2.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2 tumor corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
4,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC Stage of the cancer.

First, we need to identify the primary tumor site, which is the liver (Segments 1-4 and portion of 8). The tumor size is 10 cm, and it's a poorly differentiated cholangiocarcinoma.

Next, we need to assess the tumor's invasion and metastasis. The report mentions vascular invasion and perineural invasion, which are both present. However, there is no evidence of distant metastasis.

The lymph node status is unknown, as no lymph nodes were received.

The surgical margins are close but negative for malignancy.

Based on the TNM staging system, the primary tumor (T) is classified as pT3, as it's a tumor larger than 5 cm. The nodal status (N) is pNX, as the lymph nodes were not assessed. The metastasis status (M) is M0, as there is no evidence of distant metastasis.

According to the AJCC staging system, a pT3 pNX M0 corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
