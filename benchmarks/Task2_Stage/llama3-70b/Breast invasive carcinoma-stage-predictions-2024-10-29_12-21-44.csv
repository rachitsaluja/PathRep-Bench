Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC Stage of the Cancer.

1. The report mentions ""pT4b"", which indicates the primary tumor (T) is at least 5 cm in size and has extended to the chest wall or skin, with ulceration and/or satellite nodules.
2. The report also mentions ""pN1a (1/11)"", which indicates that one or more axillary lymph nodes are involved (N1), but not more than three.
3. There is no mention of distant metastases, so the M category is ""pMx"", which means it cannot be assessed.
4. The report concludes with ""stage III B. R1"", which suggests that the tumor is at an advanced stage, with residual tumor remaining after surgery (R1).

Considering the above points, the correct stage is Stage III, as it involves a large primary tumor (T4b) and regional lymph node involvement (N1a), but no distant metastases.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III B""}"

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC Stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions the diagnosis as Infiltrative ductal carcinoma, which is a type of breast cancer.
2. The T Stage is 2, which means the tumor is larger than 2 cm but not larger than 5 cm in greatest dimension.
3. The N Stage is 0, indicating that there is no regional lymph node metastasis.
4. The M Stage is 0, indicating that there is no distant metastasis.

Based on the TNM staging system, a T2N0M0 corresponds to Stage II breast cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
2,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the Cancer:

1. The diagnosis mentions a multifocal poorly differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma with three tumor foci of sizes 7 cm, 2.2 cm, and 1.7 cm. This indicates a large tumor size, which is a key factor in determining the T stage.

2. The report mentions focal ulceration of the skin, which is a characteristic of T4b tumors. According to the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, T4b is defined as ""ulceration and/or ipsilateral satellite nodules"" and is classified as a T4 tumor.

3. The report also mentions circumscribed intraductal spread, which does not affect the T stage.

4. Focal angioinvasion is mentioned, but it does not impact the T stage either.

5. The tumor-free dorsal resection margin indicates that the tumor has not invaded the resection margin, which is a positive finding.

6. The tumor classification is provided as pT4b(mult)N3aL1V0R0. Here, pT4b indicates the primary tumor stage, which is T4b as discussed earlier. The ""(mult)"" suffix indicates multifocality, which does not affect the T stage.

7. The N3a stage indicates that there are metastases in ipsilateral infraclavicular (level III axillary) lymph nodes. This is a key factor in determining the N stage.

8. The L1 stage indicates that there is lymphovascular invasion, which does not impact the N stage.

9. The V0 stage indicates that there is no venous invasion, which does not impact the N stage.

10. The R0 stage indicates that the resection margins are tumor-free, which is a positive finding.

Considering the T4b primary tumor stage and the N3a nodal stage, the overall AJCC Stage of the Cancer is Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
3,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor (pT) is classified as pT2(m), which means the tumor is larger than 2 cm but not larger than 5 cm in greatest dimension. This is based on the two foci of invasive lobular carcinoma, measuring 1.9 cm and 2.2 cm.

2. The lymph nodes (pN) are classified as pNO(sn), which means no regional lymph node metastases are present. This is based on the fact that 0 out of 4 sentinel lymph nodes are positive for cancer.

3. The metastasis (pM) is classified as pMX, which means distant metastases cannot be assessed.

Based on the pT, pN, and pM classifications, we can determine the overall AJCC stage.

According to the AJCC 7th edition staging system, a pT2 tumor with no lymph node involvement (pNO) and no distant metastases (pMX) corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
4,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is described as a moderately differentiated infiltrating ductal carcinoma, measuring 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm, with a microscopic distance of 2.6 cm. This corresponds to a T2 tumor (T1: ≤ 2 cm, T2: > 2 cm but ≤ 5 cm).

2. The tumor extends to within 0.8 cm of the medial margin and 0.7 cm from both the superficial and deep margins, but the margins are not involved. This does not affect the T stage.

3. The lymph node status is critical in determining the N stage. Sentinel lymph node #1 is negative for metastatic disease, but sentinel lymph node #2 contains an isolated tumor cell cluster, 0.1 mm, in a capsular lymphatic space. This corresponds to an N1mi tumor (micrometastasis in 1-3 lymph nodes).

4. There is no evidence of distant metastases (M0).

Based on the TNM staging system, the patient's cancer can be classified as T2N1miM0. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, this corresponds to Stage IIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IIA""}"
5,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor size is 0.9 cm, which corresponds to a T1b stage (T stage, pathologic: pT1b).
2. There is no lymph node involvement (LYMPH NODES POSITIVE: 0, LYMPH NODES EXAMINED: 2), which corresponds to an N0 stage (N stage, pathologic: pNO).
3. There is no mention of distant metastases, and the M stage is reported as pMX, which means it is unknown or cannot be assessed. However, in the absence of any evidence of distant metastases, we can assume it is M0.
4. Combining the T, N, and M stages, we get: T1b, N0, M0.

According to the AJCC staging system, a T1b, N0, M0 corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
6,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can see that:

1. The tumor size is at least 3 cm in greatest dimension, which corresponds to T2.
2. Lymphovascular invasion is identified, which is a negative prognostic factor.
3. Metastatic carcinoma is present in two of twenty-one lymph nodes, which corresponds to N1.

There is no evidence of distant metastasis (M0).

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2 tumor with N1 lymph node involvement corresponds to Stage IIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IIA""}"
7,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor (pT) is classified as pT1b(m), which means the tumor is 6 mm in size (main lesion) and 3.2 mm in size (satellite lesion), with multiple foci (m).

2. The lymph nodes (pN) are classified as NO(sn), which means there is no evidence of metastatic carcinoma in the sentinel lymph nodes (0/2).

3. The distant metastasis (pM) is classified as Mx, which means it is unknown or cannot be assessed.

According to the AJCC 7th edition staging system, a tumor with a size of T1b (≤ 2 cm) and no lymph node involvement (N0) is classified as Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
8,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The tumor size is 1.8 cm in largest dimension (T1).
* There is no lymph node involvement (N0) as all sentinel and non-sentinel lymph nodes are benign.
* There is no distant metastasis (M0) as there is no evidence of tumor in the right breast or any other distant sites.

According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a size of 1.8 cm (T1) and no lymph node involvement (N0) and no distant metastasis (M0) corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage I}"
9,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Tumor size**: The tumor size is 3.0 cm, which is a significant factor in determining the T stage. According to the AJCC 8th edition, a tumor size of 3.0 cm corresponds to a T2 stage.

2. **Lymphovascular space invasion**: The report mentions lymphovascular space invasion, which is a negative prognostic factor. However, it does not provide information about lymph node involvement, which is crucial for determining the N stage.

3. **Tumor extension to the deep surgical margin**: The tumor extends to within 1 mm of the deep surgical margin, which may indicate a higher risk of local recurrence. However, this factor is not directly related to the AJCC staging system.

4. **No information about lymph node involvement**: The report does not provide information about lymph node involvement, which is essential for determining the N stage.

5. **No distant metastases mentioned**: There is no mention of distant metastases in the report, which suggests that the M stage is likely M0.

Based on the available information, we can determine the T stage as T2 (tumor size 3.0 cm). However, we cannot determine the N stage due to the lack of information about lymph node involvement. Therefore, we cannot assign a specific AJCC stage (I-IV) with certainty.

However, considering the T2 stage and the absence of distant metastases, the most likely stage would be Stage II (T2, Nx, M0).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
10,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions that the patient underwent a left simple mastectomy and sentinel node biopsy. The sentinel lymph nodes (#1 and #2) are negative for tumor (0/1 and 0/1, respectively).
2. The left breast mastectomy specimen shows an intraductal apocrine ductal carcinoma with lobular cancerization and rare foci of invasion (largest focus 3mm). There is also a separate mass of intraductal and infiltrating ductal carcinoma (2.5 cm) inferior to the hemorrhagic region.
3. The breast pathologic parameters indicate that the invasive carcinoma measures 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm, with a composite histologic grade of III.
4. The excisional biopsy margins are free of tumor, with margins greater than 2mm away.
5. There is no blood vessel or lymphatic invasion.
6. The axillary lymph nodes are negative for tumor (0/2).
7. The pTNM staging is pT2, N0, MX.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* The primary tumor (pT) is stage T2, as the invasive carcinoma measures more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm in greatest dimension.
* The regional lymph nodes (N) are stage N0, as there is no evidence of lymph node involvement.
* The distant metastases (M) are stage MX, as the presence or absence of distant metastases cannot be assessed.

Therefore, the AJCC stage is Stage II (T2, N0, MX).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
11,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Primary tumor (T): The tumor size is 3.5 x 2.5 x 1.7 cm, and it involves the posterior resection margin, inferior resection margin, and comes close to the anterior resection margin. This corresponds to a pT2 tumor.

2. Lymph nodes (N): Three out of 28 lymph nodes are positive for metastatic disease, with extracapsular extension (0.2 cm). This corresponds to a pN1a lymph node stage.

3. Distant metastases (M): There is no evidence of distant metastases in the report, so the M stage is pMX (cannot be assessed).

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a pT2 tumor with pN1a lymph nodes and pMX distant metastases corresponds to Stage IIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IIA}"
12,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC Stage of the Cancer.

1. The diagnosis is bifocal poorly differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma, which means there are two tumor foci.
2. The tumor diameters are 2.5 cm and 0.7 cm, which indicates the size of the tumors.
3. The concluding tumor classification is NOS (Not Otherwise Specified), G III (Grade 3, which is a high-grade tumor), pT2 (the primary tumor is larger than 2 cm but not larger than 5 cm), mult (there are multiple tumors), NO (no regional lymph node metastasis), sn (sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed), LO (lymphovascular invasion is not present), VORO (no vascular invasion, no orbital invasion).

Now, let's analyze the information to determine the AJCC Stage:

* The primary tumor is larger than 2 cm but not larger than 5 cm (pT2), which corresponds to T2.
* There is no regional lymph node metastasis (NO), which corresponds to N0.
* There is no distant metastasis mentioned in the report, which corresponds to M0.

According to the AJCC Staging System, a tumor with T2, N0, and M0 corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"

2. The lymph node status shows that 1 out of 2 sentinel lymph nodes and 1 out of 8 level 1 and 2 lymph nodes contain metastatic carcinoma, with the largest metastasis being 9 mm. This corresponds to N1 (metastasis in 1-3 axillary lymph nodes).
3. There is no mention of distant metastases, so M0 (no distant metastases).
4. Combining the T, N, and M categories, we get a PTNM stage of T2N1MX, which corresponds to Stage IIA (T2N1M0).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IIA}"
14,"## Answer

From the pathology report, we can identify the AJCC Stage of the Cancer as follows:

1. The primary tumor size is 3.0cm, which corresponds to pT2 (Tumor greater than or equal to 2.0-5.0cm).
2. The regional lymph nodes show metastasis in 2 out of 13 lymph nodes, which corresponds to pN1a (Metastasis in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes).
3. There is no distant metastasis, which corresponds to pMX (cannot be assessed).
4. Combining the pT, pN, and pM categories, we get the AJCC pathologic stage as pT2N1aMx.

According to the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, the stage corresponding to pT2N1aMx is Stage IIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IIA""}"
15,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor (pT) is classified as pT2, which means the tumor is greater than 2 cm but not greater than 5 cm in size.
2. There is no ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) present.
3. Angiolymphatic invasion is absent.
4. The surgical resection margins are negative for tumor, indicating that the tumor has been completely removed.
5. The lymph nodes, specifically the right axillary sentinel lymph nodes, are negative for metastatic carcinoma, classified as pNO (i-) (sn).

Based on these findings, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* The primary tumor (pT) is pT2, which corresponds to a T2 classification.
* The lymph nodes (pN) are pNO, which corresponds to an N0 classification.
* There is no mention of distant metastases (pM), so we can assume it is pM0.

16,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor size is 1.3 cm x 1.2 cm x 1.0 cm, which is less than 2 cm in greatest dimension. This corresponds to T1 according to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual.

2. The report mentions that one of the 23 right axillary lymph nodes has metastatic carcinoma with extracapsular extension. This indicates that the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes, specifically N2 according to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual.

3. There is no mention of distant metastases (M) in the report.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

T1 (tumor size < 2 cm) + N2 (metastasis to axillary lymph nodes with extracapsular extension) + M0 (no distant metastases) = Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
17,"## Answer

From the pathology report, we can identify the following key features:

1. The tumor size is 3.0 cm (pT2).
2. There is one lymph node involved by metastatic mammary carcinoma (9 mm) and one lymph node involved by micrometastatic mammary carcinoma (1 mm) (N1a).

According to the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, the TNM stage is determined by the primary tumor (T), regional lymph nodes (N), and distant metastases (M). In this case, the TNM stage is pT2 N1a.

Based on the TNM stage, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* pT2 indicates a tumor size between 2.0 cm and 5.0 cm.
* N1a indicates that one to three axillary lymph nodes are involved by metastatic cancer.

Therefore, the AJCC stage is Stage II.

2. The report mentions ""pT3NOLOVORO"", which indicates the tumor classification:
   - pT3: Primary tumor is 9 cm in diameter (as mentioned earlier).
   - N0: No regional lymph node metastasis.
   - L0: No lymphovascular invasion.
   - V0: No venous invasion.
   - R0: Resection margins are tumor-free (as mentioned in the report).

3. Based on the TNM classification, the patient has a T3 tumor (large tumor size) with no lymph node metastasis (N0) and no distant metastasis (not mentioned in the report, but assumed to be M0 since it's not mentioned).

4. According to the AJCC Stage grouping, a T3N0M0 tumor corresponds to Stage III.

20,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor (T) is described as an invasive ductal carcinoma measuring 1.5 cm in greatest dimension, located in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. This corresponds to a T1 tumor (T1: tumor ≤ 2 cm in greatest dimension).

2. The lymph nodes (N) are described as having a single keratin-positive cell suspicious for an isolated tumor cell in one lymph node (out of two sentinel lymph nodes). This corresponds to an N0(i+) tumor (N0(i+): no regional lymph node metastases, but with isolated tumor cells).

3. There is no mention of distant metastases (M) in the report, so we can assume M0 (no distant metastases).

Based on the TNM classification, the AJCC stage is determined as follows:

* T1 (primary tumor ≤ 2 cm)
* N0(i+) (isolated tumor cells in one lymph node)
* M0 (no distant metastases)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, this corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
21,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The tumor size is 2.0 cm, 1.9 cm, and 1.1 cm in maximum dimension, which corresponds to T2 (tumor size > 2 cm but ≤ 5 cm).
* There is perineural invasion, but it does not affect the T stage.
* The tumor is not more than 0.1 cm from the medial margin, 1 mm and 2 mm from the deep and anterior margins, respectively, which indicates close margins but not a T4 tumor.
* There is metastatic adenocarcinoma involving one of one sentinel lymph node (1/1), with a maximum size of metastasis of 0.3 cm, and extranodal extension is not identified.
* Additionally, there is metastatic adenocarcinoma in one of one lymph node (1/1) in the palpable lymph node, left axilla, with a maximum size of metastasis of 0.9 cm, and extranodal extension is present, measuring 0.1 cm in maximum dimension.
* There is also metastatic adenocarcinoma in three of thirty-one lymph nodes (3/31) in the left axillary contents, with a maximum size of metastasis of 0.4 cm, and extranodal extension is present, measuring 0.5 mm in maximum dimension.

Based on the lymph node involvement, we can see that there are multiple lymph nodes involved, including sentinel lymph nodes, palpable lymph nodes, and axillary contents, with extranodal extension present in some of them. This corresponds to N3 (metastases in 10 or more axillary lymph nodes, or in clinically apparent internal mammary lymph nodes in the absence of axillary lymph node metastases).

Since there is no evidence of distant metastasis, the M stage is M0.

Therefore, the AJCC stage of the cancer is T2N3M0, which corresponds to Stage III.

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can gather the following information:

* Tumor size: The invasive carcinoma involves an area of approximately 8.5 cm in the lateral aspect of the left breast.
* Lymph node involvement: There is metastatic carcinoma in one sentinel lymph node (7.0 mm in greatest microscopic dimension) with extranodal extension (2.0 mm in greatest dimension). Additionally, there are metastases in nine of twenty-one lymph nodes in the left axillary contents, with the largest lymph node metastasis measuring 5.0 mm in greatest microscopic dimension. Focal extranodal extension is also present.
* Distant metastasis: There is no evidence of distant metastasis in the report.

Based on the AJCC staging system, a tumor size of 8.5 cm corresponds to T3. The presence of metastases in multiple lymph nodes (N2) and extranodal extension further supports a higher stage.

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions ""Infiltrating ductal carcinoma"" with a size of 1.3 x 1.3 x 1.2 cm, which corresponds to AJCC pT1c (primary tumor size > 1 cm but ≤ 2 cm).
2. There is no mention of angiolymphatic invasion, which is a negative prognostic factor.
3. The report states that all surgical resection margins are negative for tumor, indicating that the tumor has not invaded the margins.
4. The lymph nodes, specifically the right axillary sentinel lymph nodes, are negative for metastatic carcinoma, which corresponds to AJCC pNO (i-) (sn). This indicates that there is no nodal involvement.

Considering these factors, we can determine the AJCC Stage as follows:

* Tumor size (pT1c) corresponds to T1.
* No nodal involvement (pNO) corresponds to N0.
* There is no mention of distant metastases, so M0 is assumed.

31,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor (pT) is classified as pT3, which means the tumor is greater than 5 cm in size (9.2 x 4.2 x 3.2 cm).

2. The report states that the tumor does not involve the nipple, skin, or underlying chest wall, which rules out pT4.

3. The sentinel lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma, which is classified as pN0 (i-).

4. There is no mention of distant metastases, which would be classified as M1.

According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a pT3 primary tumor and pN0 lymph nodes would be classified as Stage IIA or Stage IIIA, depending on the presence of other factors.

34,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor size is 4.3 x 2.3 x 2.7 cm, which corresponds to a T2 tumor (T1: ≤ 2 cm, T2: > 2 cm but ≤ 5 cm, T3: > 5 cm).
2. The tumor has invaded the axillary lymph nodes (Metastases carcinomatosae in lymphonodis axillae, No II/XVII), which corresponds to an N1a lymph node status (N1a: Metastases in 1-3 axillary lymph nodes).
3. There is no mention of distant metastases (M0).
4. Combining the T and N stages, we get a stage of at least II (T2N1a).

Considering the above points, the patient's cancer stage is likely Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
35,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The tumor is multicentric in situ and infiltrating lobular carcinoma, spanning a gross distance of 7.0 cm from medial to lateral in the superior central portion of the specimen.
* The tumor is nuclear grade II/III with a low mitotic index.
* The superficial and deep margins are free of tumor by at least 1 cm.
* There is no evidence of metastatic disease in the sentinel lymph nodes (Parts A, B, E, F, and G).
* There is no evidence of malignancy in the right simple mastectomy specimen (Part D).

Based on the tumor size (T3) and the absence of lymph node involvement (N0), we can determine the stage as follows:

* Tumor size (T): T3 (tumor > 5 cm)
* Lymph node involvement (N): N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis)
* Distant metastasis (M): M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a size > 5 cm and no lymph node involvement or distant metastasis corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
36,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis.

* There is no lymph node involvement, as all sentinel lymph nodes are negative for malignancy (pNO).
* There is no distant metastasis mentioned in the report.

According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a size of 2.8 cm and no lymph node involvement corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
37,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions a ""moderately differentiated infiltrating lobular carcinoma"" in the left breast, which indicates an invasive carcinoma.
2. The tumor size is not explicitly stated, but we can infer it from the gross description: ""a 3.2 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm tumor centrally extending into the upper inner quadrant."" This suggests a tumor size of approximately 3.2 cm in greatest dimension.
3. The report mentions that the tumor extends into the skin of the nipple and involves the upper outer quadrant, but does not involve the deep surgical margin. This indicates skin involvement, which is a key factor in staging.
4. There is no mention of lymph node involvement or distant metastases.

Based on the above information, we can determine the T stage (primary tumor) as T4, due to the skin involvement. The N stage (lymph nodes) is NX, as there is no information about lymph node involvement. The M stage (distant metastases) is M0, as there is no evidence of distant metastases.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T4 tumor with NX lymph nodes and M0 distant metastases corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"

5. The non-sentinel lymph node (PART 3: NON-SENTINEL LYMPH NODE, LEFT) is negative for metastatic tumor.

6. There is no evidence of distant metastases (M0) in the report.

Based on the above findings, the AJCC stage of the cancer is:

T3b (primary tumor > 5 cm with skin involvement)
N1mi (micrometastases in 1-3 lymph nodes)
M0 (no distant metastases)

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
70,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor (pT) is classified as pT1c, which corresponds to a tumor size of 1-2 cm in greatest dimension. This is a relatively small tumor.

2. The lymph nodes (pN) are classified as pN1mi(sn), which indicates micrometastasis in one or more sentinel lymph nodes. The size of the largest metastasis is 0.6 mm, which is a small metastasis.

3. There is no extranodal extension, and the surgical margins are negative for tumor.

4. There is no mention of distant metastases (pM) in the report.

Based on the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a size of 1-2 cm (pT1c) and micrometastasis in sentinel lymph nodes (pN1mi(sn)) corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
71,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor (pT) is classified as pT1c, which corresponds to a tumor size of 1-2 cm in diameter. This is a relatively small tumor.

2. There is no angiolymphatic invasion, which is a good prognostic factor.

3. The surgical resection margins are negative for tumor, indicating that the tumor has been completely removed.

4. However, the lymph nodes (pN) are positive for metastatic carcinoma, with 3 out of 25 lymph nodes affected. This is classified as pN1, which indicates that the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes.

5. The presence of extranodal extension in the lymph nodes is a poor prognostic factor.

Considering the tumor size (pT1c) and the presence of lymph node metastases with extranodal extension (pN1), the AJCC stage of the cancer is likely to be Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
72,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Primary tumor (T): The tumor size is 2.7 cm, which corresponds to a T2 tumor.
2. Lymph nodes (N): There is an isolated tumor cell cluster (ITC) in one lymph node, which is classified as N0(i+). This means that there are no metastatic carcinoma cells in the lymph nodes, but there are isolated tumor cells present.
3. Distant metastases (M): There is no mention of distant metastases in the report, so we can assume M0 (no distant metastases).

According to the AJCC staging system, a T2 tumor with N0(i+) lymph nodes and M0 distant metastases corresponds to Stage II cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
73,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the Cancer.

1. The diagnosis mentions ""bifocal poorly differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma"", which indicates that there are two separate tumor foci.

2. The tumor diameters are 2.8 cm and 0.8 cm, which suggests that the larger tumor is greater than 2 cm in size.

3. The concluding tumor classification is ""NOS, G III, pT2(mult)NOLOVORO"". 
   - ""NOS"" stands for ""Not Otherwise Specified"", which is a histological grade.
   - ""G III"" indicates that the tumor is poorly differentiated (high-grade).
   - ""pT2"" indicates that the primary tumor is larger than 2 cm but not larger than 5 cm in greatest dimension.
   - ""(mult)"" suggests that the tumor is multifocal (has multiple foci).
   - ""NO"" indicates that there is no regional lymph node involvement.
   - ""LO"" and ""VO"" are not relevant for staging.
   - ""RO"" suggests that there is no distant metastasis.

4. Based on the pT2 classification and the absence of regional lymph node involvement (NO) and distant metastasis (RO), we can determine the stage.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
74,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the primary tumor (T), regional lymph nodes (N), and distant metastasis (M).

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* Primary tumor (T): The tumor is an infiltrating ductal carcinoma, poorly differentiated, with a size of 6.0 cm in greatest dimension (pT3).
* Regional lymph nodes (N): No carcinoma is seen in the sentinel lymph nodes (pNO).
* Distant metastasis (M): Not applicable (MX).

According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a size of 6.0 cm or larger is classified as T3. Since there is no lymph node involvement (pNO) and no distant metastasis, the overall stage is Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage II}"
75,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

2. Lymph nodes: There are 3/5 positive lymph nodes, which indicates N1 disease (1-3 positive axillary lymph nodes).

3. Metastasis: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report.

4. Combining the T and N stages, we get a stage of at least II.

Considering the above factors, the patient's cancer stage is likely Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
76,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor (pT) is classified as pT3, which means the tumor is greater than 5 cm in size (5.7 x 4.8 x 2.1 cm).

2. The lymph node status (pN) is classified as pN3, which means there are 4 or more positive axillary lymph nodes (14 of 16 axillary lymph nodes are positive for metastatic carcinoma).

3. There is no evidence of distant metastases (M0) in the report.

According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a pT3 primary tumor and pN3 lymph node status corresponds to Stage III.

77,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the cancer:

1. The diagnosis is a ""NEILTRATING DUCTAL CARCINOMA, NOT OTHERWISE SPECIFIED"" which is a type of invasive breast cancer.
2. The tumor size is 6.0 cm, which is a significant factor in determining the T stage (primary tumor).
3. The tumor has extended to within 1 mm of the line of resection, indicating a close margin.
4. There is massive vascular permeation, including the nipple, which suggests lymphovascular invasion.
5. Three out of fifteen (3/15) axillary lymph nodes are positive for metastatic tumor with capsular and extracapsular extension, indicating nodal involvement.

Based on the AJCC staging system, we can determine the stage as follows:

* T stage: The tumor size is 6.0 cm, which corresponds to a T3 stage (T3: tumor > 5 cm).
* N stage: Three axillary lymph nodes are positive with extracapsular extension, which corresponds to an N2 stage (N2: metastases in 4-9 axillary lymph nodes, or clinically detected internal mammary lymph nodes in the absence of axillary lymph node involvement).
* M stage: There is no mention of distant metastases, so the M stage is M0 (no distant metastases).

Therefore, the overall stage is determined by the highest stage among T, N, and M. In this case, the highest stage is N2, which corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is -

92,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Primary tumor (T): The report states that the tumor size is 2.7 cm, and it involves the smooth muscle of the nipple. According to the AJCC 8th edition, a tumor size of 2.7 cm corresponds to T2.
2. Lymph nodes (N): The report shows that one sentinel lymph node is positive for metastatic carcinoma, and one non-sentinel lymph node is completely replaced by metastatic carcinoma. The presence of extranodal extension in the non-sentinel lymph node cannot be assessed due to the lack of perinodal soft tissue. According to the AJCC 8th edition, this corresponds to N1a.
3. Distant metastases (M): The report does not mention any distant metastases, so M0 is assumed.

Based on the above information, the pathologic stage is pT2 N1a MX, which corresponds to Stage IIA according to the AJCC 8th edition.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
93,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the Cancer.

1. The diagnosis is moderately differentiated invasive lobular carcinoma with a tumor diameter of 8 cm.
2. The tumor classification is pT3, which means the tumor is larger than 5 cm in diameter (T3: Tumor > 5 cm in greatest dimension).
3. The lymph node status is N0, indicating no regional lymph node metastasis.
4. The lymphovascular invasion status is L0, indicating no lymphovascular invasion.
5. The venous invasion status is V0, indicating no venous invasion.
6. The resection margin status is R1, indicating microscopic residual tumor present at the resection margin.

Now, let's refer to the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual to determine the stage based on the TNM classification.
