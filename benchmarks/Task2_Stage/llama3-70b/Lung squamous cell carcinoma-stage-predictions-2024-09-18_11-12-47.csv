Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor (pT) is classified as pT3, which means the tumor is larger than 5 cm or has invaded the mediastinum or involves the visceral pleura.
2. The regional lymph nodes (pN) are classified as pN1, which means there is metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes.
3. The metastasis (pM) is classified as pMX, which means distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Based on the pT3 and pN1 classifications, the AJCC stage is Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
1,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions a 1.1 cm moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in the lung, which is T1a according to the AJCC 8th edition staging system (tumor size ≤ 1 cm).
2. The tumor invades the overlying pleura, which is classified as PL1 (invasion of visceral pleura). This does not affect the T stage.
3. There is no lymphovascular invasion mentioned in the report.
4. The report states that the benign intrapulmonary lymph node is negative for carcinoma, indicating that there is no nodal involvement (N0).
5. The margin of resection is negative for carcinoma, which is not relevant for staging.
6. The sixth rib resection is negative for carcinoma, which suggests that there is no distant metastasis (M0).
7. Since the tumor is T1a, N0, and M0, we can determine the stage based on the AJCC 8th edition staging system.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
2,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor (T) is described as a 27 mm poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma in the right upper lobe, with focal blood vessel and perineural invasion, but no lymphatic permeation. This corresponds to a T1 tumor, as it is ≤ 3 cm in size.

2. The lymph nodes (N) are involved, with a deposit of poorly differentiated carcinoma present within the hilar lymph node cortex. This indicates N1 disease, as the tumor has metastasized to the hilar lymph nodes.

3. There is no mention of distant metastases (M) in the report, so we can assume M0.

Based on the TNM classification, the patient has a T1N1M0 tumor.

According to the AJCC staging system, a T1N1M0 tumor corresponds to Stage IIA.

However, the options provided do not include Stage IIA. The closest match is Stage II, which is a reasonable approximation given the T1N1M0 classification.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
3,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the left lung, and it is a Grade II-III squamous carcinoma that involves the pleura and focally extends to the inked pleural margin.
2. The tumor size is not explicitly mentioned, but based on the gross description, it appears to be at least 4.5 cm in greatest dimension.
3. The vascular and bronchial margins of resection are negative, indicating that the tumor has not invaded these areas.
4. There are multiple lymph nodes examined, but none of them show evidence of tumor involvement (0/1 in Level 9, 0/1 in Level 10, 0/6 in the left lung, 0/3 in Level 5, and 0/1 in Level 7).

Based on the TNM staging system, the primary tumor (T) is at least T3 due to its size and involvement of the pleura. The absence of tumor involvement in the lymph nodes (N) indicates N0. Since there is no evidence of distant metastases (M), the M stage is M0.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T3N0M0 tumor corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
4,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (T)**: The tumor is described as an exophytic invasive moderately to poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, measuring 3.7 x 2.8 x 2.8 cm. According to the AJCC 8th edition, this corresponds to a T2 tumor, as it is larger than 3 cm but not larger than 5 cm.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N)**: The report indicates that one out of ten peribronchial lymph nodes is positive for metastasis (N1). This suggests that the tumor has spread to the ipsilateral hilar and/or peribronchial lymph nodes.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: There is no evidence of distant metastasis (M0).

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* T2 (primary tumor size)
* N1 (lymph node involvement)
* M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, this corresponds to **Stage IIA**.

However, since the options provided do not include Stage IIA, we need to consider the closest match. Stage II is not a perfect match, as it would require N0 (no lymph node involvement) or N1 (ipsilateral hilar and/or peribronchial lymph nodes), but not both. Stage III is also not a perfect match, as it would require N2 (ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes) or N3 (contralateral mediastinal/hilar, scalene, or supraclavicular lymph nodes), which is not the case here.

Given the options provided, the closest match would be **(B) Stage II**, as it is the most similar to the actual stage (Stage IIA).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage II}"
5,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor type is squamous cell carcinoma, and the histologic grade is moderately differentiated.
2. The tumor size is 2.4 cm, which corresponds to T1b (tumor size > 2 cm but ≤ 3 cm).
3. The surgical margins are free of tumor, and there is no direct extension of the tumor.
4. Lymphatic and venous invasions are absent.
5. A total of 7 lymph nodes were examined, and none of them were involved with cancer (pNO).
6. The tumor approaches but does not involve the visceral pleura.

Based on these findings, the TNM staging is pT1b, pNO, and pMX (metastasis cannot be assessed).

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a tumor with T1b and N0 staging corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
6,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor (pT) is classified as pT2a, which means the tumor is > 3 cm and < 5 cm in greatest dimension, surrounded by lung or visceral pleura, without bronchoscopic evidence of invasion in the main bronchus.
2. The regional lymph nodes (pN) are classified as pNO, which means there is no regional lymph node metastasis.
3. There is no mention of distant metastasis (pM) in the report.

Based on the TNM classification, the patient's cancer can be staged as follows:

* Tumor (T): T2a (primary tumor is > 3 cm and < 5 cm in greatest dimension)
* Node (N): N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis)
* Metastasis (M): M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a patient with a T2a, N0, M0 classification corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
7,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumour size is 45 mm in diameter, which corresponds to T2a according to the AJCC 8th edition staging system.
2. The tumour abuts the visceral pleura, but there is no pleural invasion, which is consistent with T2a.
3. The tumour is clear of the bronchial resection margin, with no lymphatic, vascular, or perineural invasion present.
4. The peribronchial lymph nodes, as well as the separately submitted left hilar lymph node and mediastinal lymph node, are not involved by tumour, which corresponds to N0.

Based on the above findings, the pathological stage is pT2a NO.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a tumour with a T2a primary tumour and no nodal involvement (N0) corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is -
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
8,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the Cancer:

1. The report mentions a primary tumor in the right lower lobe of the lung, measuring 5 x 4.5 x 2.6 cm, which is a significant size. However, it does not extend through the pleura, indicating that it is still localized within the lung.

2. The bronchial margin is negative for tumor, which means that the tumor has not invaded the bronchus.

3. Multiple intrapulmonary peribronchial lymph nodes (6) are negative for tumor, indicating that the tumor has not spread to these lymph nodes.

4. Multiple superior and inferior mediastinal lymph nodes (a total of 11) and N1 lymph nodes (3) are also negative for tumor, indicating that the tumor has not spread to these lymph nodes.

Based on these findings, we can conclude that the tumor is localized to the right lower lobe of the lung and has not spread to any lymph nodes. According to the AJCC staging system, this corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
9,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the left upper lobe of the lung, and its greatest diameter is 3.2 cm, which corresponds to a T2 tumor (T1: ≤ 3 cm, T2: > 3 cm but ≤ 5 cm, T3: > 5 cm but ≤ 7 cm, T4: > 7 cm).
2. The tumor involves the visceral pleura, but there is no vascular invasion, perineural invasion, or bronchial margin involvement.
3. The lymph node status is as follows: peribronchial lymph nodes are 0/8, indicating no metastasis to these nodes.
4. Multiple mediastinal lymph nodes were examined (Levels 5, 6, 7, and 11), and all were benign, with no evidence of metastasis.

Based on the above information, we can determine the N stage as N0, since there is no metastasis to any of the examined lymph nodes.

Combining the T and N stages, we get a stage of T2N0. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2N0 tumor corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage II}"
10,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

First, we need to identify the primary tumor (pT) stage, which is pT1b. This indicates that the tumor is 2 cm or less in size and has not invaded the visceral pleura.

Next, we need to determine the regional lymph node (pN) stage, which is pNO. This means that the lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

Since the lymph nodes are negative, we can rule out Stage III and Stage IV, which would require lymph node involvement.

Now, let's look at the distant metastasis (pM) stage, which is not applicable. This means that there is no evidence of distant metastasis.

Given the pT1b and pNO stages, we can conclude that the cancer is localized to the primary site and has not spread to the lymph nodes or distant sites.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
11,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary tumor (T stage)**: The report states that the tumor is an invasive squamous cell carcinoma, 4.5 cm in diameter, with visceral pleural and angiolymphatic invasion. This corresponds to a T4 stage, as the tumor has invaded the visceral pleura.

2. **Lymph node involvement (N stage)**: The report mentions that one out of 12 N1 lymph nodes is positive for metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. This corresponds to an N1 stage, as there is involvement of ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes.

3. **Distant metastasis (M stage)**: The report does not mention any distant metastases, so the M stage is MX (cannot be assessed).

Based on the T4N1MX staging, the AJCC stage of the cancer is **Stage III**.

Therefore, the answer is -

12,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the Cancer:

1. The report mentions a 2.3 x 2 x 1.8 cm mass in the left upper lobe lung, which is a primary tumor (T). Since it abuts but does not directly invade the pleura, it is classified as T1 (tumor ≤ 3 cm in greatest dimension, surrounded by lung or visceral pleura, and does not invade the visceral pleura).

2. The report states that the bronchial margin is negative, indicating that there is no tumor involvement at the bronchial resection margin.

3. The report mentions that multiple lymph nodes were excised, including inferior mediastinal, aortic, and N1 lymph nodes. However, all of these lymph nodes are negative for tumor, indicating that there is no nodal involvement (N0).

4. Since there is no mention of distant metastases (M) in the report, we can assume that there is no evidence of distant metastases (M0).

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC Stage of the Cancer as follows:

* T1 (primary tumor ≤ 3 cm in greatest dimension)
* N0 (no nodal involvement)
* M0 (no distant metastases)

According to the AJCC 8th Edition Staging System, a T1N0M0 classification corresponds to Stage I.

13,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the left lung, and its size is 2.5 cm (PT2).
2. The pleura, bronchial, and vascular margins are negative for tumor.
3. There is no involvement of the lymph nodes in the lung (N0).
4. The tumor has invaded the left main bronchus.

According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a size of 2.5 cm (PT2) and no lymph node involvement (N0) would correspond to Stage I or Stage II. However, since the tumor has invaded the left main bronchus, it is classified as Stage II (T2N0M0).

Therefore, the answer is -

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions the tumor size as 4.2999999999999998 cm, which is greater than 3 cm but less than 5 cm. According to the AJCC staging system, this corresponds to a T2a tumor.

2. The report also mentions that the Pathological N (lymph node involvement) is N1, which means there is metastasis to 1-3 lymph nodes.

3. The Clinical M (distant metastasis) is MO, indicating there is no distant metastasis.

4. Combining the T, N, and M stages, we get T2a, N1, and MO.

5. According to the AJCC staging system, a T2a, N1, and MO corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is -

15,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Tumor size**: The tumor size is 3 X 3 X 3.5 cm, which is a significant factor in determining the T stage. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a tumor of this size would correspond to a T2 stage (tumors > 3 cm but ≤ 5 cm in greatest dimension).

2. **Lymph nodes**: The report does not specify the involvement of lymph nodes, which means we cannot determine the N stage from this information.

3. **Metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, which suggests that the M stage is likely M0 (no distant metastasis).

4. **Tumor extent**: The report does not specify the tumor extent, which could be a crucial factor in determining the T stage. However, based on the tumor size, we can infer that the tumor is likely confined to the lung.

Considering the available information, we can conclude that the tumor is at least T2 (due to its size) and M0 (no distant metastasis). Since there is no information about lymph node involvement, we cannot determine the N stage.

Given the options, the most likely answer is **(A) Stage I**, as it is possible that the tumor is T2N0M0, which corresponds to Stage I. However, please note that this is an incomplete pathology report, and a more comprehensive report would be necessary to determine the stage with certainty.

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (T)**: The tumor size is 4.2 x 4.0 x 2.3 cm, which corresponds to T2a (tumor > 3 cm but ≤ 5 cm in greatest dimension). Additionally, there is visceral pleural invasion, which does not affect the T stage.

2. **Lymph Node Status (N)**: Only one peribronchial node was received, and it did not contain metastatic carcinoma, so the N stage is NO (no regional lymph node metastasis).

3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so the M stage is M0 (no distant metastasis).

Based on the TNM stages, the overall AJCC stage is Stage II (T2a NO M0).

18,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions ""Squamous cell carcinoma"" as the histological description, which indicates the type of cancer.

2. The TNM Stage is mentioned as T2, N2, M0.

3. According to the AJCC staging system, T2 indicates a tumor larger than 3 cm but not larger than 5 cm, or a tumor that invades the main bronchus but is not closer than 2 cm to the carina.

4. N2 indicates metastasis to ipsilateral mediastinal or subcarinal lymph nodes.

5. M0 indicates no distant metastasis.

6. Based on the TNM Stage, we can determine the overall stage of the cancer. According to the AJCC staging system, a T2, N2, M0 corresponds to Stage IIIA.

19,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

First, we need to identify the T, N, and M stages from the report.

* T stage: The tumour is 57 mm in greatest dimension, and it invades into the pericardium. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, this corresponds to a T3 stage (tumour > 5 cm or invading the pericardium).
* N stage: The report states ""No lymph node metastases"", which corresponds to an N0 stage.
* M stage: There is no mention of distant metastases in the report, so we can assume an M0 stage.

Now, we can determine the overall stage based on the T, N, and M stages. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T3 N0 M0 stage corresponds to Stage III.

21,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the primary tumor (T), lymph nodes (N), and distant metastasis (M).

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The primary tumor (T) is classified as pT3, which means the tumor is larger than 5 cm or invades the chest wall (as mentioned in the report).
* The lymph nodes (N) are classified as pNO, which means no regional lymph node metastasis is found.
* There is no mention of distant metastasis (M) in the report.

According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a pT3 classification and no lymph node involvement (pNO) would correspond to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is -

24,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Tumor size**: The tumor size is 3 x 2 x 2 cm, which is a relatively small size. This suggests that the primary tumor (T) is likely to be T1 or T2, as T3 tumors are typically larger than 5 cm.

2. **Lymph nodes**: The report states that 3 out of 6 lymph nodes are positive for metastasis, which indicates that the cancer has spread to the regional lymph nodes. This corresponds to N2, as N2 is defined as metastasis to ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes.

3. **Distant metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, which suggests that M0 (no distant metastasis) is likely.

4. **Combining T, N, and M**: Based on the above analysis, we have T1 or T2, N2, and M0. According to the AJCC staging system, this corresponds to Stage IIIA.

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the cancer.

1. **Tumor size**: The tumor size is 8 x 8 x 8 cm, which is a significant size, but it doesn't directly determine the stage.

2. **Tumor extent**: The tumor has invaded the visceral pleura, which indicates a T2 or higher classification (T2: tumor invades visceral pleura).

3. **Lymph nodes**: 8 out of 10 lymph nodes are positive for metastasis, which is a significant number. This indicates an N2 classification (N2: metastasis to ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes).

4. **Distant metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report.

Considering the above factors, we can determine the TNM classification as follows:

* T: T2 (tumor invades visceral pleura)

Let's break down the given pathology report to identify the AJCC Stage of the Cancer.

Upon reviewing the report, I notice that it lacks essential information required to determine the AJCC Stage, such as tumor size, lymph node involvement, and metastasis. The report appears to be a general template for collecting pathology information, but it does not provide the necessary details to stage the cancer.

The report does mention ""ICD-0-3 Histology Code"" and ""ICD-0-3 Site Code,"" which could be relevant for identifying the type and location of the tumor, but it does not provide the actual codes or descriptions.

Given the lack of information, it is not possible to accurately determine the AJCC Stage of the Cancer from this report.

27,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor is a squamous cell carcinoma, moderately differentiated, with a maximal tumor size of 7.7 cm. This corresponds to a T2 tumor, as it is greater than 3 cm in greatest dimension.
2. The visceral pleura is invaded, which is also consistent with a T2 tumor.
3. There is no regional lymph node metastasis, as all peribronchial lymph nodes (6 lobar and 1 segmental) are negative for malignancy. This corresponds to an N0 node status.
4. There is no mention of distant metastasis, so the M status is M0.

Based on the TNM staging system, a T2N0M0 tumor corresponds to Stage II.

{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
28,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the left upper lobe of the lung, measuring 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm, and is 1.8 cm away from the bronchial margin, which is negative for tumor. This suggests that the tumor is confined to the lung and has not invaded the bronchial margin.

2. The report mentions that multiple (10) intrapulmonary peribronchial lymph nodes are positive for tumor, which indicates lymph node involvement.

3. The visceral pleura is also involved, which suggests that the tumor has invaded the pleura.

4. The report also mentions that multiple lymph nodes in the superior mediastinal, aortic, inferior mediastinal, and left lower lobe bronchus regions are negative for tumor.

Considering the above points, we can determine the T, N, and M stages as follows:

* T stage: The tumor is 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm in size and has invaded the visceral pleura, which corresponds to a T2b stage (tumor > 2 cm in greatest dimension and invades the visceral pleura).
* N stage: The presence of tumor in multiple intrapulmonary peribronchial lymph nodes corresponds to an N1 stage (metastasis to intrapulmonary nodes).
* M stage: There is no evidence of distant metastasis, so the M stage is M0.

Based on the T, N, and M stages, we can determine the overall AJCC stage. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2bN1M0 stage corresponds to Stage IIA.

However, since the options provided do not include Stage IIA, we need to consider the closest match. Given that the tumor has invaded the visceral pleura and has lymph node involvement, the closest match would be Stage III.

2. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a tumor size of 3 cm or less corresponds to a T1 stage.
3. There is no mention of lymph node involvement or distant metastases in the report, which suggests that the N stage (lymph node involvement) and M stage (distant metastases) are likely N0 and M0, respectively.
4. Since the report does not provide information on lymph node involvement or distant metastases, we cannot rule out the possibility of N1, N2, or M1 stages. However, based on the available information, it is reasonable to assume that the N and M stages are likely to be N0 and M0, respectively.
5. Combining the T1 stage with the assumed N0 and M0 stages, we can determine the overall stage of the cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
32,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (T)**: The tumor size is 4.0 cm, which corresponds to pT2 (tumor with any of the following features of size or extent: greater than 3 cm in greatest dimension).
2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N)**: One lobar lymph node out of nine lymph nodes is positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma, which corresponds to pN1 (metastasis in ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes, including intrapulmonary nodes involved by direct extension of the primary tumor).
3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: There is no evidence of distant metastasis (pMX: Cannot be assessed).

Based on the pT2 and pN1 classifications, the patient's cancer is at least Stage II. However, since the tumor has invaded the venous vessels (V) and there is no evidence of distant metastasis, we can rule out Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is -
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
33,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (pT)**: The report states that the tumor measures 4.9 cm in maximum dimension, which corresponds to pT2a (Tumor > 3 cm, and < 5 cm in greatest dimension surrounded by lung or visceral pleura, without bronchoscopic evidence of invasion in the main bronchus).

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN)**: The report indicates that multiple lymph nodes were excised and examined, but none of them showed malignancy (0/6). This corresponds to pN0 (No regional lymph node metastasis).

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM)**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so pM is not applicable.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

**AJCC Stage**: The combination of pT2a and pN0 corresponds to Stage II (T2a, N0, M0).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
34,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary tumor (pT)**: The tumor measures 5.5 cm in dimension and extends through the pleura but is not identified at the outer surface of the specimen. This corresponds to a T2b tumor (tumor > 5 cm in greatest dimension).
2. **Margins of resection**: The margins are negative for tumor, which is a good prognostic factor.
3. **Direct extension of tumor**: The tumor extends into the pleura, which shows a desmoplastic response to tumor, but is not identified at the outer surface of the specimen.
4. **Vessel invasion**: Not identified.
5. **Regional lymph nodes (pN)**: pNO, meaning no regional lymph node metastases are identified.
6. **Distant metastasis (pM)**: pMx, meaning distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* Tumor (T): T2b (tumor > 5 cm in greatest dimension)
* Node (N): N0 (no regional lymph node metastases)
* Metastasis (M): Mx (distant metastasis cannot be assessed)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2bN0Mx tumor corresponds to **Stage II**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
35,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to analyze the pathology report and identify the key factors that affect staging.

First, we need to identify the primary tumor (T) stage. The report states that the tumor size is 4.9 x 4.7 x 4.5 cm, and it invades through the pleura into the chest wall skeletal muscle and into rib bone. This corresponds to a T3 stage, as the tumor has invaded the chest wall.

Next, we need to determine the nodal (N) stage. The report states that the lobar lymph nodes are negative for carcinoma, which means that the cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes. This corresponds to an N0 stage.

Finally, we need to determine the metastasis (M) stage. The report does not mention any distant metastases, so we can assume that the M stage is M0.

Based on the TNM classification, the pathologic stage is pT3 pNO PL3. According to the AJCC staging system, a T3 tumor with no nodal involvement and no distant metastases corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
36,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer:

1. The primary tumor (T) is described as a 4.5 x 4 x 3 cm intrabronchial and parenchymal hilar mass, which is a significant size. However, there is no mention of invasion into the pleura, which would be a T3 or T4 descriptor. Therefore, the primary tumor is likely a T2.

2. The report mentions that the tumor extends to within a few millimeters of the bronchial margin, which is involved by extensive in situ carcinoma. This does not affect the T stage.

3. The lymph node involvement is extensive, with metastases in multiple intrapulmonary peribronchial lymph nodes (6 of 14), aortopulmonary lymph nodes (2 of 2), and anterior mediastinal lymph nodes (1 of 2). This indicates N2 disease, as there are metastases in mediastinal lymph nodes.

4. There is no mention of distant metastases (M1) in the report.

Based on the above analysis, the TNM stage is T2N2M0, which corresponds to Stage III according to the AJCC staging system.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
37,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can see that the tumor is 3.5 cm in greatest dimension, which corresponds to T2a (tumor >2 cm but ≤3 cm in greatest dimension).

The report also mentions that the closest inked pleural margin is negative for malignancy, and the bronchus and blood vessels at the surgical margin are negative for malignancy, indicating no invasion of the pleura or blood vessels.

Regarding lymph node involvement, the report states that no hilar lymph nodes are identified, and all lymph nodes examined (anterior lobular, subcarinal, right hilum, and right lower peritracheal area) are benign anthracotic lymph nodes, indicating no lymph node metastasis (N0).

There is no evidence of distant metastasis (M0) in the report.

Based on the above information, the tumor can be staged as T2a, N0, M0, which corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
38,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the right lower lobe lung, measuring 2.9 x 2.5 x 1.8 cm.
2. The tumor extends subpleurally but not to the pleural surface, which suggests a T2a tumor (since it's larger than 2 cm but not more than 3 cm in greatest dimension).
3. There is no vascular invasion or perineural invasion identified.
4. The bronchial margin is free of tumor.
5. The lymph node status is as follows: all lymph nodes examined (Level VII mediastinal, Level VII mediastinal #2, and Right mediastinal lymph node level XI) are benign, with no metastatic nodes identified. This suggests an N0 lymph node status.
6. There is no evidence of distant metastasis (M0) in the report.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* T2a (primary tumor size and extension)
* N0 (no lymph node metastasis)
* M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2a, N0, M0 tumor corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is -

{""stage"" : ""Stage IB""}"
40,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions that the tumor is staged as pT3 due to the presence of separate tumor nodules in the same lobe, away from the main central tumor.
2. The tumor size is reported as 5.5 cm x 4.0 cm x 3.5 cm, which is greater than 7 cm in greatest dimension, making it a T3 tumor.
3. There is no evidence of chest wall invasion, diaphragmatic invasion, or mediastinal pleura invasion, which would have upgraded the T stage.
4. The report states that all margins are negative for invasive carcinoma, including the bronchial margin, vascular margin, and parenchymal margin.
5. There is no evidence of lymphovascular invasion or extranodal extension.
6. The report mentions that 8 lymph nodes were examined, and none of them showed metastatic carcinoma, making it pN0.
7. There is no mention of distant metastasis, making it pM0.

Based on the above information, the TNM staging is pT3N0M0.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a pT3N0M0 tumor corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is -
{""stage"" : Stage II}"
41,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Tumor size**: The tumor size is 6.5 x 5.5 x 5.5 cm, which is a significant size. However, the AJCC staging system does not directly correlate tumor size with stage.

2. **Tumor extent**: The tumor extent is not specified, which means we cannot determine if the tumor has invaded nearby structures or not.

3. **Lymph nodes**: 0/6 lymph nodes are positive for metastasis, which indicates that there is no lymph node involvement.

4. **Distant metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report.

Based on the available information, we can conclude that the tumor is large (T2 or T3) and has not invaded nearby structures (no tumor extent specified). There is no lymph node involvement (N0) and no distant metastasis (M0).

According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a large size (T2 or T3) and no lymph node involvement (N0) and no distant metastasis (M0) corresponds to **Stage II**.

46,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The tumor is located in the right lower lobe of the lung, and its greatest diameter is 5.0 cm.
* The tumor has invaded the mainstem bronchus and has perineural invasion.
* The tumor has extended to the hilar soft tissue margin.
* There is metastatic carcinoma in regional lymph nodes, with 6/9 peribronchial lymph nodes and 1/1 parenchymal lymph nodes involved.
* There is no tumor involvement in the pleura or pericardium.

Based on the AJCC 8th edition staging system, the tumor size (T) is T3, as it has invaded the mainstem bronchus. The lymph node involvement (N) is N2, as there are metastases in the ipsilateral mediastinal lymph nodes. There is no distant metastasis (M0).

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary diagnosis is a large-cell, polymorphocellular, and partly gigantocellular, barely keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma in the upper lobe of the left lung, with localization in the boundary region of segments 1-3.
2. The tumor size is approximately 9 cm, which corresponds to T2 (tumor > 5 cm but ≤ 7 cm).
3. The tumor extends to the pleura in the region of adhesion, but there is no evidence of visceral pleura infiltration. This suggests that the tumor has invaded the parietal pleura (P1).
4. The tumor has also extended to the medial pleura over S2, with a 0.5 cm crack in the surface and suture material.
5. The lymph nodes are involved, with multiple lesioned grayish-black nodes or node parts in stations 10, 11, 12, and 5. This indicates N2 (metastasis to ipsilateral mediastinal or subcarinal lymph nodes).
6. There is no evidence of distant metastasis (M0).

49,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions that the carcinoma involves the pleural surface, which indicates that the tumor has invaded the visceral pleura (T2).
2. All surgical margins of resection are negative for tumor, which suggests that the tumor has not invaded the surrounding tissues (R0 resection).
3. The report mentions that one hilar lymph node and associated fibroadipose tissue are negative for tumor, which indicates that there is no lymph node involvement (N0).
4. Additionally, two other lymph nodes (Station 5 and L11) are also negative for tumor, further supporting the absence of lymph node involvement.

Based on the above findings, we can determine the T, N, and M stages as follows:

* T stage: T2 (tumor invades the visceral pleura)
* N stage: N0 (no lymph node involvement)
* M stage: M0 (no distant metastases mentioned in the report)

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions a ""poorly-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma"" with a maximal dimension of 37mm, which corresponds to a T2 tumor (Tumor size > 3 cm but ≤ 5 cm).
2. There is no evidence of pleural invasion, blood vessel invasion, lymphatic permeation, or perineural permeation, which suggests that the tumor has not invaded nearby structures.
3. The report states that the tumor is ""well clear of the bronchial resection margin,"" indicating that the tumor has not invaded the bronchial margin.
4. The peribronchial lymph nodes show sinus histiocytosis and contain carbon pigment, but there is no evidence of metastases, which means that the lymph nodes are not involved (N0).
5. There is no mention of distant metastases (Mx), which means that the presence or absence of distant metastases is unknown.

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor size is 4 X 3 X 3.5 cm, which is larger than 3 cm but not more than 5 cm. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, this corresponds to a T2 tumor.

2. There is no information about tumor extent, lymph nodes, lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, or margins, which are important factors in determining the N and M components of the TNM staging system. However, the absence of information does not necessarily imply the absence of these features.

3. Since there is no information about lymph node involvement or distant metastases, we cannot determine the N and M components. However, we can infer that the M component is likely M0 (no distant metastases) since there is no mention of metastases in the report.

4. Given the T2 tumor and unknown N and M components, we can narrow down the possible stages to Stage I, II, or III.

5. Since there is no information to suggest lymph node involvement or distant metastases, the most likely stage is Stage I, which corresponds to a T1 or T2 tumor with N0 and M0 components.

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor (T) is a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, 28 mm in maximal dimension, located in the right upper lobe. The tumor appears to directly invade a peribronchial lymph node. There is no blood vessel, lymphatic, or perineural invasion present. According to the AJCC 8th edition, this corresponds to a T2 tumor (tumor > 20 mm but ≤ 30 mm in greatest dimension).

2. The lymph nodes (N) are involved, as evidenced by the squamous cell carcinoma deposit in the lymph node (specimen 8). This is classified as N1 (metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial and/or hilar lymph nodes and intrapulmonary nodes, including involvement by direct extension).

3. There is no evidence of distant metastasis (M0).

Based on the TNM classification, the patient has a T2N1M0 tumor, which corresponds to Stage IIA according to the AJCC 8th edition.

However, since the options provided do not include Stage IIA, we need to consider the closest match. Stage II (B) is the closest match, as it also corresponds to a T2N1M0 tumor.

2. The tumor does not involve the visceral pleura, and there is no lymphovascular space invasion.
3. The pleural, bronchial, and vascular margins are free of tumor.
4. No metastatic carcinoma is seen in 11 peribronchial lymph nodes (0/11), which means N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis).
5. There is no mention of distant metastasis (Mx, which means metastasis cannot be assessed).

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

From the report, we know that the tumor is an invasive moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, 4.5 cm in size, located in the right lower lobe of the lung. The tumor has not invaded any lymph nodes (pNO) and has not metastasized to distant sites (M stage not applicable).

The T stage is pT2a, which corresponds to a tumor larger than 3 cm but not more than 5 cm in greatest dimension.

Since the N stage is pNO (no lymph node involvement) and the M stage is not applicable (no distant metastases), we can focus on the T stage to determine the overall stage.

3. There is no visceral pleural invasion, but findings are suspicious for lymphovascular invasion.
4. The tumor appears confined to the lung, and the distance from the bronchial margin is 2.0 cm, and from the pleural surface is less than 0.1 cm.
5. The lymph node status shows that none of the 2 lymph nodes received contain metastatic carcinoma (0/2).
6. However, the report mentions a revision, stating that upon re-review, a satellite tumor is discovered, which classifies the neoplasm as a stage T3.

Based on the revised classification, the tumor is pT3NO, which corresponds to Stage II.
