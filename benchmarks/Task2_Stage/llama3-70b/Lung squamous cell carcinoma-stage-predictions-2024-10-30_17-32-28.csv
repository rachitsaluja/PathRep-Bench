From the pathology report, we can identify the following key features:

1. The tumor is a squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, with a maximum diameter of 6.3 cm.
2. The tumor invades the visceral pleura and parietal pericardium, but not the chest wall or mediastinum.
3. There is vascular invasion present.
4. The tumor has metastasized to 3 out of 10 lymph nodes (pN1).

According to the AJCC 6th Edition staging system, a tumor with these features would be classified as:

* pT3: The tumor is larger than 5 cm and invades the visceral pleura and parietal pericardium.
* pN1: The tumor has metastasized to 1-3 lymph nodes.
* pMX: The presence of distant metastases cannot be assessed.

Therefore, the overall stage would be Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
1,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions a 1.1 cm moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in the right lung, which has invaded the overlying pleura. This indicates a T2a tumor (since it's ≤2 cm in size and has invaded the pleura).

2. The report also mentions that the margin of resection is negative for carcinoma, which suggests that the tumor has been completely resected.

3. There is no lymphovascular invasion seen, which is a good prognostic factor.

4. The report mentions a benign intrapulmonary lymph node, which is negative for carcinoma, indicating that there is no nodal involvement (N0).

5. The patient has a history of left upper lobe carcinoma, which suggests that this might be a metastatic lesion. However, the report does not mention any other metastatic lesions or distant metastases.

6. The report also includes a resection of the 6th rib, which is negative for carcinoma, suggesting that there is no bone involvement.

Considering the above factors, the tumor can be staged as follows:

* T2a (tumor size ≤2 cm and invasion of the pleura)
* N0 (no nodal involvement)
* M0 (no distant metastases)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2a N0 M0 tumor corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
2,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor is a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, 27 mm in maximal dimension, located in the right upper lobe.
2. The tumor shows blood vessel and perineural invasion, but no lymphatic permeation is seen.
3. There is no definite pleural invasion identified, and the tumor is clear of the bronchial margin.
4. Hilar lymph node metastases are present, indicating that the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes.

Based on the TNM staging system, we can assign the following values:

* T: The tumor is 27 mm in size, which corresponds to T1 (tumor ≤ 3 cm in greatest dimension).
* N: The presence of hilar lymph node metastases corresponds to N1 (metastasis in ipsilateral peribronchial and/or hilar lymph nodes).
* M: There is no evidence of distant metastases, so M0 (no distant metastasis).

Therefore, the overall stage is determined by the TNM values: T1N1M0.

According to the AJCC staging system, a T1N1M0 corresponds to Stage IIA.

However, the options provided do not include Stage IIA. The closest match is Stage II, which is a reasonable approximation given the TNM values.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
3,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the left lung, and it measures 4.5 X 3.5 X 2.0cm. The tumor involves the pleura and focally extends to the inked pleural margin.

2. The bronchial margin is negative for tumor, indicating that the tumor has not invaded the bronchus.

3. There is no vascular invasion, as the vascular margin is negative for tumor.

4. The tumor is a Grade II-III squamous carcinoma of the lung.

5. The lymph nodes are negative for tumor in all levels, including level 9, level 10, level 5, and level 7.

Based on the above information, we can determine the T, N, and M stages as follows:

* T stage: The tumor is T2a, as it measures more than 3cm but less than 5cm in greatest dimension.
* N stage: The N stage is N0, as all lymph nodes are negative for tumor.
* M stage: There is no evidence of distant metastasis, so the M stage is M0.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2a, N0, M0 tumor corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
4,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to analyze the pathology report and identify the key factors that influence staging.

1. **Primary Tumor (T)**: The tumor size is 3.7 x 2.8 x 2.8 cm, which corresponds to a T2 tumor (tumors > 3 cm but ≤ 5 cm in greatest dimension).
2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N)**: The report indicates that 1 out of 13 lymph nodes is positive for metastasis, which corresponds to N1 disease (ipsilateral hilar and/or peribronchial lymph nodes).
3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: There is no evidence of distant metastasis, so M is classified as MX (cannot be assessed).

Based on these factors, we can determine the pathological stage using the AJCC 8th edition staging system.

The pT2 tumor, combined with N1 lymph node involvement and no distant metastasis (MX), corresponds to **Stage IIA**.

However, since the options provided do not include Stage IIA, we need to consider the closest match. Stage II is a possible match, as it also corresponds to a T2 tumor with N1 lymph node involvement. Although the exact staging is Stage IIA, the closest match among the provided options is **(B) Stage II**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage II}"
5,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor type is squamous cell carcinoma, and the histologic grade is moderately differentiated.
2. The tumor size is 2.4 cm, which corresponds to T1b (tumor 2-3 cm in greatest dimension).
3. The surgical margins are all free of tumor, and there is no direct extension of the tumor.
4. Lymphatic and venous invasions are absent.
5. A total of 7 lymph nodes were examined, and none of them were involved with cancer (pNO).
6. The tumor approaches but does not involve the visceral pleura.

Based on the above information, we can determine the TNM staging as follows:

* T: T1b (tumor 2-3 cm in greatest dimension)
* N: N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis)
* M: MX (distant metastasis cannot be assessed)

According to the AJCC staging system, a T1bN0MX corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
6,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor (pT) is classified as pT2a, which means the tumor is > 3 cm and < 5 cm in greatest dimension, surrounded by lung or visceral pleura, without bronchoscopic evidence of invasion in the main bronchus.
2. The regional lymph nodes (pN) are classified as pNO, which means there is no regional lymph node metastasis.
3. There is no mention of distant metastasis (pM), so it is not applicable.

According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a pT2a classification and pNO lymph nodes would correspond to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
7,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumour size is 45 mm in diameter, which corresponds to T2a (tumour > 3 cm but ≤ 5 cm).
2. There is no pleural invasion, lymphatic invasion, vascular invasion, or perineural invasion.
3. The tumour is clear of the bronchial resection margin, with only focal mild and moderate squamous dysplasia at the margin.
4. The peribronchial lymph nodes, left hilar lymph node, and mediastinal lymph node are not involved by tumour, indicating N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis).

Based on these findings, the pathological stage is pT2a NO. According to the AJCC staging system, a T2a tumour with no nodal involvement (N0) corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
8,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the Cancer.

1. The report mentions a primary tumor in the right lower lobe lung, measuring 5 X 4.5 X 2.6 cm, which is a significant size. However, it does not extend through the pleura, which suggests that the tumor is still localized within the lung.

2. The bronchial margin is negative for tumor, indicating that the tumor has not invaded the bronchus.

3. Multiple intrapulmonary peribronchial lymph nodes (6) are negative for tumor, which suggests that the tumor has not spread to these lymph nodes.

4. The report also mentions that multiple superior and inferior mediastinal lymph nodes (a total of 11) and N1 lymph nodes (3 right interlobar) are negative for tumor. This indicates that the tumor has not spread to the regional lymph nodes.

Considering these findings, the tumor is localized within the lung, has not invaded the pleura or bronchus, and has not spread to the regional lymph nodes. Therefore, the tumor is classified as T2 (due to its size), N0 (no regional lymph node involvement), and M0 (no distant metastasis).

According to the AJCC Staging System, a T2N0M0 tumor corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
9,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The patient has a squamous cell carcinoma of the left upper lobe, poorly differentiated, with a tumor size of 3.2 cm (T2).
2. There is no vascular invasion or perineural invasion.
3. The bronchial margin is free of tumor.
4. The tumor involves the visceral pleura (PL1).
5. There is no in situ carcinoma.
6. The lymph node status is as follows: peribronchial: 0/8, indicating no metastatic nodes in the peribronchial region.
7. Multiple mediastinal lymph nodes were examined, and all were benign (no metastatic nodes).

Based on the above information, we can determine the TNM stage as follows:

* T: T2 (tumor size > 3 cm)
* N: N0 (no metastatic nodes in the peribronchial or mediastinal regions)
* M: M0 (no distant metastases mentioned in the report)
* PL: PL1 (tumor involves the visceral pleura)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2N0M0 tumor with PL1 corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
10,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Primary tumor (pT): The report states that the primary tumor is pT1b, which means the tumor is 2 cm or less in size and has not invaded the visceral pleura.

2. Regional lymph nodes (pN): The report states that the regional lymph nodes are pNO, which means there is no evidence of tumor in the lymph nodes.

3. Distant metastasis (pM): The report states that distant metastasis is not applicable, which means there is no evidence of distant metastasis.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage of the cancer. Since the primary tumor is pT1b and there is no evidence of regional lymph node involvement (pNO) or distant metastasis, the AJCC stage is Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
11,"## Answer

The patient's pathology report indicates a primary lung tumor with the following characteristics:

* Tumor location: Right upper lobe
* Tumor size: 4.5 cm (maximum dimension) and 3.5 cm (minor dimension)
* Gross satellites: 1
* Tumor type: Invasive squamous carcinoma
* Histologic grade: Moderately differentiated (G2)
* Visceral pleural invasion: Present
* Angiolymphatic invasion: Present
* Tumor necrosis: > 50%
* Surgical margin involvement: No
* N1 lymph nodes: 1 out of 12 positive

12,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the Cancer:

1. The report describes a lung wedge excision with a 2.3 x 2 x 1.8 cm mass abutting but not directly invading the pleura, which suggests a T1 tumor (since it's ≤ 3 cm in size and doesn't invade the pleura).
2. The report also mentions that the bronchial margin is negative, which implies that the tumor hasn't invaded the bronchus.
3. The lymph nodes examined, including inferior mediastinal, aortic, and N1 lymph nodes, are all negative for tumor, which suggests that there is no nodal involvement (N0).
4. Since there is no mention of distant metastases, we can assume that there is no M1 disease.

Based on these findings, we can determine the AJCC Stage as follows:

* T1 (tumor size ≤ 3 cm and doesn't invade the pleura)
* N0 (no nodal involvement)
* M0 (no distant metastases)

According to the AJCC Staging System, a T1N0M0 tumor corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is -

13,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the left lung, and its size is 2.5 cm (PT2).
2. The pleura, bronchial, and vascular margins are negative for tumor, indicating no local invasion.
3. There is no involvement of the peribronchial lymph nodes (0/9), which suggests N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis).
4. The tumor involves the left main bronchus, but this does not affect the T or N stage.
5. There is no evidence of distant metastasis (M0) based on the report.

According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a size of 2.5 cm (PT2), no regional lymph node metastasis (N0), and no distant metastasis (M0) corresponds to Stage IIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
14,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions the tumor size as 4.2999999999999998 cm, which is not a critical factor in determining the stage.
2. The histology is squamous carcinoma, and the grade/differentiation is III, which also does not directly impact the stage.
3. The pathological T (pT) is T2a, which means the tumor is larger than 3 cm but not larger than 5 cm, and has not invaded the main bronchus or the visceral pleura.
4. The pathological N (pN) is N1, indicating that the cancer has spread to ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes, and/or intrapulmonary nodes involved by direct extension of the primary tumor.
5. The clinical M (cM) is M0, indicating that there is no distant metastasis.

Based on the AJCC staging system, a T2a tumor with N1 nodes and M0 distant metastasis corresponds to Stage IIIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IIIA""}"
15,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor size is 3 X 3 X 3.5 cm, which is a significant factor in determining the T stage (primary tumor size). According to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual, a tumor size of 3-4 cm corresponds to a T1b stage.

2. There is no information about the involvement of lymph nodes (N stage) or distant metastases (M stage) in the report. This lack of information makes it difficult to determine the N and M stages.

3. Since the report only provides information about the primary tumor size, we can only determine the T stage (T1b). Without information about the N and M stages, we cannot determine the overall stage of the cancer.

4. Considering the available information, the most likely answer is (A) Stage I, as it is the earliest stage that includes a T1b tumor. However, please note that this answer is based on incomplete information and may not be accurate.

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (T)**: The tumor size is 4.2 x 4.0 x 2.3 cm, and it invades the visceral pleura. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual, this corresponds to a T2a tumor (tumor > 3 cm but ≤ 5 cm in greatest dimension, and invades the visceral pleura).

2. **Lymph Node Status (N)**: Only one peribronchial lymph node was received, and it did not contain metastatic carcinoma. Therefore, the lymph node status is NO (no regional lymph node metastases).

3. **Distant Metastases (M)**: There is no mention of distant metastases in the pathology report.

Based on the above information, the pTNM stage is pT2a NO, which corresponds to **Stage II** according to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual.

Therefore, the answer is -

17,"## Answer

The patient's pathology report indicates a primary lung tumor with a size of 5.0 cm, moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, with metastasis to one of twelve N1 lymph nodes and associated with angiolymphatic invasion. The tumor is located in the right lower lobe, and all margins are free.

The pathologic stage is reported as T2 N1 MX. The T stage is T2, indicating a tumor size between 3 cm and 7 cm. The N stage is N1, indicating metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes. The M stage is MX, indicating that distant metastases cannot be assessed.

Based on the AJCC staging system, a T2 N1 tumor corresponds to Stage IIA. However, since the M stage is MX, we cannot rule out the possibility of distant metastases. Therefore, the final stage is Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is -

18,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions ""Squamous cell carcinoma"" as the histological description, which indicates the type of cancer.
2. The TNM Stage is provided as T2, N0, M0.
   - T2 indicates the tumor is larger than 3 cm but not larger than 5 cm, or it's a tumor that's 5 cm or smaller and has grown into the bronchus, but not into the main bronchus near the carina.
   - N0 indicates there is no regional lymph node metastasis.
   - M0 indicates there is no distant metastasis.

Based on the TNM Stage, we can determine the overall stage of the cancer.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2, N0, M0 corresponds to Stage I.

{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
19,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor size is 57 mm, which corresponds to T3 (tumor > 5 cm).
2. The tumor invades the pericardium, but not through to the inner mesothelial-lined surface, which is still considered T3.
3. There is no evidence of pleural invasion on the opposite aspect of the specimen to the adherent pericardium.
4. Vascular, lymphatic, and perineural invasion are present, but this does not affect the T stage.
5. The bronchial resection margin is clear of malignancy.
6. There are no lymph node metastases (NO).

Based on the above information, the pathological stage is T3 NO. Since there is no evidence of distant metastases (M0), the overall stage is determined by the T and N stages.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
20,"## Answer

From the pathology report, we can identify the key features of the cancer:

1. The tumor is a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma located in the apical segment of the right lower lobe, measuring 52 mm in diameter.
2. The tumor invades the parietal pleura, but the soft tissue resection margin is clear of malignancy.
3. There is extensive vascular invasion present.
4. Focal perineural invasion is present.
5. No lymphatic invasion is found.
6. Metastatic carcinoma is present in the No. 11 lymph node (N1).

Based on these features, we can determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

The primary tumor (T) is classified as T3 due to the tumor size (>5 cm) and invasion of the parietal pleura.

The lymph node involvement (N) is classified as N1 due to the presence of metastatic carcinoma in the No. 11 lymph node.

There is no evidence of distant metastasis (M), so M0.

Therefore, the AJCC stage of the cancer is Stage III (T3 N1 M0).

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the left lung, and its size is 11.0 cm, which corresponds to a T2 tumor (tumor > 5 cm but ≤ 7 cm).
2. The visceral pleural, bronchial, and vascular margins are negative for tumor, indicating no local invasion.
3. One out of twelve peribronchial lymph nodes is positive for metastatic carcinoma, which corresponds to an N1 nodal status (metastasis in ipsilateral peribronchial lymph nodes).
4. The report also mentions that lymph nodes from levels 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10 were examined, with only one lymph node from level 10 being positive for metastatic carcinoma.

Based on the TNM classification, the patient has a T2 primary tumor, N1 nodal status, and no distant metastases (M0). According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, this corresponds to Stage IIA (T2 N1 M0).

24,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Tumor size: 3 X 2 X 2 cm - This information is not sufficient to determine the T stage, as we need to know the exact size and location of the tumor to determine if it's T1, T2, or T3.
2. Histologic type: Squamous cell carcinoma - This information is not relevant for staging.
3. Histologic grade: Poorly differentiated - This information is not relevant for staging.
4. Tumor extent: Not specified - This information is not sufficient to determine the T stage.
5. Other tumor nodules: Not specified - This information is not sufficient to determine the T stage.
6. Lymph nodes: 3/6 positive for metastasis (Intrathoracical 3/6) - This indicates that there is lymph node involvement, which is a key factor in determining the N stage. With 3 out of 6 lymph nodes positive for metastasis, the N stage is likely N2.

Based on the available information, we can conclude that the patient has a T stage that is unknown (Tx) and an N stage of N2. According to the AJCC staging system, a patient with an N2 stage has a minimum stage of Stage III.

25,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Tumor size: 8 x 8 x 8 cm - This is a large tumor, but tumor size alone does not determine the stage.
2. Tumor extent: Visceral pleura - This indicates that the tumor has invaded the visceral pleura, which is a key factor in determining the T descriptor. According to the AJCC 8th edition, this corresponds to a T3 descriptor.
3. Lymph nodes: 8/10 positive for metastasis (Intrathoracical 8/10) - This indicates that there are metastases in the intrathoracic lymph nodes, which corresponds to an N2 descriptor.
4. There is no evidence of distant metastases (M descriptor) in the report.

Based on the T3 and N2 descriptors, we can determine the stage. According to the AJCC 8th edition, a T3N2 corresponds to Stage IIIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IIIA""}"
26,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the Cancer.

1. The report does not provide explicit information about the tumor size (T), lymph node involvement (N), or distant metastasis (M), which are essential components for determining the AJCC Stage.

2. The report focuses on administrative and logistical information, such as the tumor type, BCR location, date specimen received, ICD-0-3 Histology Code, and ICD-0-3 Site Code. These details do not provide direct clues about the stage of the cancer.

3. Without specific information about the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis, it is challenging to determine the AJCC Stage accurately.

4. Given the lack of relevant information, it is not possible to confidently assign a specific stage (I, II, III, or IV) to the cancer.

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor is a squamous cell carcinoma, moderately differentiated, with a maximal tumor size of 7.7 cm.
2. The tumor invades the visceral pleura, which is a key feature for T-stage determination.
3. The pathologic staging (pTNM) is reported as pT2, which corresponds to a tumor with any of the following features: greater than 3 cm in greatest dimension, involves main bronchus, 2 cm or more distal to the carina, invades the visceral pleura, or associated with atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis that extends to the hilar region but does not involve the entire lung.
4. The lymph nodes are negative for malignancy, which corresponds to pN0.
5. There is no mention of distant metastases, so pM0 is assumed.

Based on the pTNM staging, the patient has a pT2 tumor (due to the size and visceral pleura invasion) and pN0 (no lymph node metastases). This corresponds to Stage II disease.

28,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the left upper lobe of the lung, measuring 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm, and is 1.8 cm away from the bronchial margin, which is negative for tumor. This suggests that the tumor is confined to the lung and has not invaded the bronchial margin.

2. The report mentions that multiple (10) intrapulmonary peribronchial lymph nodes are negative for tumor, indicating that there is no lymph node involvement within the lung.

3. However, the report also mentions that the visceral pleura is involved, which suggests that the tumor has invaded the visceral pleura, a key factor in determining the T stage.

4. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a tumor that invades the visceral pleura is classified as T2a.

5. Since there is no lymph node involvement within the lung or in the mediastinal lymph nodes (superior mediastinal, aortic, inferior mediastinal, and left lower lobe bronchus), the N stage is N0.

6. There is no evidence of distant metastases in the report, so the M stage is M0.

7. Combining the T, N, and M stages, we get a stage of T2a, N0, M0, which corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is -

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor (T) is described as a 4.5 cm poorly differentiated basaloid type squamous cell carcinoma that invades the visceral pleura but not the pericardium. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual, this corresponds to a T2 tumor, as it is larger than 3 cm but not larger than 5 cm, and invades the visceral pleura.

2. The regional lymph nodes (N) are described as pNO, meaning no lymph nodes are involved by tumor. This corresponds to an N0 designation.

3. The metastasis (M) is not mentioned in the report, and there is no evidence of distant metastases. Therefore, the M designation is MX, meaning the presence of distant metastases cannot be assessed.

4. Based on the T2, N0, and MX designations, the AJCC stage of the cancer is Stage IIA.

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Primary tumor (pT): The report mentions two mass lesions, 2.6 cm and 4 cm in greatest dimension, with visceral pleural invasion in the smaller lesion. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual, this would be classified as pT3.

2. Regional lymph nodes (pN): The report states that there is metastatic carcinoma in one of three hilar lymph nodes (pN1).

3. Distant metastasis (pM): The report indicates that there is no distant metastasis identified (pMX).

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* pT3 (primary tumor)

31,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor site is the lung, and the histologic type is squamous cell carcinoma, which is a type of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
2. The tumor size is 3 X 2.5 X 2 cm, which is a significant size, but we need to consider other factors to determine the stage.
3. There is no information about lymph node involvement, lymphatic invasion, or venous invasion, which are important factors in determining the stage.
4. The margins are not specified, which could indicate that the tumor was completely resected, but we can't be certain.
5. There is no evidence of neo-adjuvant treatment, which suggests that this is a primary tumor and not a recurrence.
6. The histologic grade is well-differentiated, which is a favorable prognostic factor, but it doesn't directly impact the stage.

Given the limited information, we can only determine the T stage (tumor size) with certainty, which is T2 (tumor size > 2 cm but ≤ 5 cm). However, we can't determine the N stage (lymph node involvement) or M stage (distant metastases) due to the lack of information.

Based on the available information, the most likely stage is Stage I, as the tumor is localized to the lung and there is no evidence of lymph node involvement or distant metastases.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
32,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor is located in the left lower lobe (LLL) of the lung, and the greatest dimension is 4.0 cm. This corresponds to a pT2 tumor, as it is greater than 3 cm in greatest dimension.
2. The tumor has invaded small venous vessels, which is indicated by the presence of venous invasion (V).
3. One lobar lymph node out of nine lymph nodes is positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma, which corresponds to pN1.
4. There is no evidence of distant metastasis (pMX cannot be assessed).

Based on the pT2 and pN1 classifications, the AJCC stage of the cancer is Stage IIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IIA}"
33,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the primary tumor (pT), regional lymph nodes (pN), and distant metastasis (pM).

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The primary tumor (pT) is classified as pT2a, which means the tumor is > 3 cm and < 5 cm in greatest dimension, surrounded by lung or visceral pleura, without bronchoscopic evidence of invasion in the main bronchus.
* The regional lymph nodes (pN) are classified as pNO, which means there is no regional lymph node metastasis.
* There is no mention of distant metastasis (pM), so we can assume it is not applicable.

Based on the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a pT2a classification and pNO lymph nodes would correspond to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
34,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary tumor (pT)**: The tumor measures 5.5 cm in dimension and extends through the pleura but is not identified at the outer surface of the specimen. This corresponds to a T2b tumor (tumor > 5 cm in greatest dimension).
2. **Margins of resection**: The margins are negative for tumor, which is a good prognostic factor.
3. **Direct extension of tumor**: The tumor extends into the pleura, which shows a desmoplastic response to tumor, but is not identified at the outer surface of the specimen.
4. **Vessel invasion**: Not identified.
5. **Regional lymph nodes (pN)**: pNO, meaning no regional lymph node metastases are identified.
6. **Distant metastasis (pM)**: pMx, meaning distant metastases cannot be assessed.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* T2b (primary tumor > 5 cm in greatest dimension)
* N0 (no regional lymph node metastases)
* Mx (distant metastases cannot be assessed)

According to the AJCC staging system, a T2bN0Mx tumor corresponds to **Stage II**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
35,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to analyze the pathology report and identify the key factors that influence staging.

1. **Primary Tumor (T)**: The tumor size is 4.9 x 4.7 x 4.5 cm, which is a significant size. The tumor also invades through the pleura into the chest wall skeletal muscle and into the rib bone, which indicates a high degree of local invasion. Therefore, the T stage is pT3.

2. **Lymph Node Status (N)**: The lymph node biopsies (#1-#5, #6, #7, #10-#12) are all negative for malignancy, indicating that there is no lymph node involvement. Therefore, the N stage is pNO.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: There is no evidence of distant metastasis in the pathology report. Therefore, the M stage is pM0.

4. **Pleural Surface Status (PL)**: The carcinoma invades through the visceral and parietal pleura into the chest wall skeletal muscle and into the rib bone, which indicates a high degree of pleural involvement. Therefore, the PL stage is PL3.

Based on the above analysis, the pathologic stage (TNM classification) is pT3 pNO PL3.

According to the AJCC staging system, a pT3 tumor with no lymph node involvement (pNO) and no distant metastasis (pM0) corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
36,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the Cancer:

1. The primary tumor (T) is described as a 4.5 x 4 x 3 cm intrabronchial and parenchymal hilar mass, which is a significant size. However, there is no mention of invasion into the pleura or chest wall, so it's likely a T2 or T3.

2. The bronchial margin is involved by extensive in situ carcinoma, but this does not affect the T stage.

3. The lymph nodes (N) are involved by metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in multiple stations, including intrapulmonary peribronchial (6 of 14), aortopulmonary (2 of 2), and anterior mediastinal (1 of 2) lymph nodes. This indicates a significant nodal involvement, likely N3.

4. There is no mention of distant metastases (M) in the report.

Based on the above analysis, the tumor is likely T2 or T3, N3, and M0. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, this corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
37,"## Answer

From the pathology report, we can identify the following key features:

1. The tumor is a poorly differentiated large cell carcinoma with squamoid features, measuring 3.5 cm in greatest dimension.
2. The tumor is predominantly endobronchial, but with pulmonary parenchymal invasion.
3. The closest inked pleural margin is negative for malignancy.
4. The bronchus and blood vessels at the surgical margin are negative for malignancy, and there is no lymphovascular invasion.
5. No hilar lymph nodes are identified with malignancy.

Based on these features, we can determine the T stage as T2a (tumor 3.5 cm in greatest dimension, with pulmonary parenchymal invasion, but not invading the visceral pleura).

Since there is no lymph node involvement (N0), the N stage is N0.

The M stage is M0, as there is no evidence of distant metastasis.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2a, N0, M0 corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
38,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The patient has a moderately to poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the right lower lobe lung, measuring 2.9 x 2.5 x 1.8 cm.
2. The tumor extends subpleurally but not to the pleural surface, and the bronchial margin is free of tumor.
3. There is no vascular invasion or perineural invasion identified.
4. The lymph node status is as follows: all lymph nodes examined (Level VII mediastinal, Level VII mediastinal #2, and Right mediastinal lymph node level XI) are benign, with no metastatic nodes identified.

Based on the above information, we can determine the T, N, and M stages as follows:

* T stage: T2 (tumor size is 2.9 cm, and it extends subpleurally but not to the pleural surface)
* N stage: N0 (no metastatic nodes identified in any of the lymph nodes examined)
* M stage: M0 (no distant metastases identified)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2N0M0 corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
39,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary diagnosis is a large, intermediate to peripheral bronchopulmonary, histologically poorly differentiated, large-cell and polymorphocellular nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma of the right lower lobe of the lung.
2. The TNM classification is provided as pT2 pNO pMX R0, which indicates:
   - pT2: The primary tumor is larger than 3 cm but not larger than 5 cm, or it is a tumor that is larger than 5 cm but not larger than 7 cm, and it has not grown into the bronchus.
   - pNO: There is no evidence of regional lymph node metastasis.
   - pMX: The presence of distant metastasis cannot be assessed.
   - R0: The surgical margins are free of tumor.
3. The report mentions that the resection margin of the bronchus and vessels and all lymph nodes identified and excised are tumor-free.

Based on the TNM classification, the patient has a pT2 tumor with no evidence of regional lymph node metastasis (pNO) and no distant metastasis (pMX). This corresponds to Stage IB according to the AJCC staging system.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IB""}"
40,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to analyze the pathology report and identify the key features that affect staging.

From the report, we can see that:

1. The tumor is a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with multiple nodules in the same lobe (upper lobe).
2. The tumor size is 5.5 cm x 4.0 cm x 3.5 cm.
3. There is no pleural or lymphovascular invasion.
4. The bronchial and vascular margins of resection are negative for carcinoma.
5. There are separate tumor nodules in the same lobe, which is a key feature for staging.
6. All lymph nodes examined (8 nodes) are negative for metastatic carcinoma.

Based on these features, we can determine the TNM descriptors as follows:

* Primary Tumor (pT): pT3 (due to the separate tumor nodule in the same lobe)
* Regional Lymph Nodes (pN): pN0 (no regional lymph node metastasis)
* Distant Metastasis (pM): pM0 (not applicable, as there is no evidence of distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC staging system, a pT3 tumor with pN0 lymph nodes and pM0 distant metastasis corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
41,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Tumor size**: The tumor size is 6.5 x 5.5 x 5.5 cm, which is a significant size. However, the AJCC staging system for lung cancer does not solely rely on tumor size.

2. **Tumor extent**: The tumor extent is not specified, which means we cannot determine if the tumor has invaded nearby structures or not.

3. **Lymph nodes**: 0/6 lymph nodes are positive for metastasis, indicating that there is no lymph node involvement.

4. **Distant metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report.

Based on the available information, we can conclude that the tumor is relatively large, but there is no lymph node involvement or distant metastasis.

According to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer, a tumor of this size (T2 or T3) with no lymph node involvement (N0) and no distant metastasis (M0) would correspond to **Stage II**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
42,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size (T), lymph node involvement (N), and distant metastasis (M).

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The tumor size is 4.5 cm (pT3), which is a significant factor in determining the stage.
* There is no lymph node involvement (NO), as all lymph nodes examined were negative for malignancy.
* There is no distant metastasis (Mx), as the report does not mention any metastases to other organs or tissues.

Based on the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a size of 4.5 cm (T3) and no lymph node involvement (N0) would correspond to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
43,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor type is squamous cell carcinoma, which is a type of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
2. The tumor size is 2x2x1.8cm, which corresponds to a T1 tumor (≤ 3 cm in greatest dimension).
3. The bronchial margin is negative, indicating that the tumor does not involve the main stem bronchus.
4. The visceral pleural margin is also negative, indicating that the tumor does not invade the visceral pleura.
5. There is no angiolymphatic invasion or perineural invasion.
6. The hilar lymph nodes (peribronchial) are negative (0/2), indicating that there is no nodal involvement.

Based on these findings, the pathologic stage is pT1N0, which corresponds to a Stage I tumor.

Therefore, the answer is -

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor (T) is described as a 3.5 cm invasive, poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma in the left lower lobe of the lung. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a tumor size of 3.5 cm corresponds to T2a.

2. The pleura and inked resection margin are negative, indicating no invasion of the visceral pleura (PL0) and no residual tumor at the resection margin (R0).

3. The lymph node (N) status is reported as N2, as one lymph node (level 9L) is negative for metastatic carcinoma (0/1). However, the presence of a lymph node at level 9L suggests that the tumor has spread to the mediastinal lymph nodes, which corresponds to N2.

4. There is no mention of distant metastases (M) in the report.

Based on the above information, the TNM staging is T2a N2 M0.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2a N2 M0 corresponds to Stage IIIA.

2. There is no evidence of visceral pleural invasion.
3. The lymph nodes (N) are classified as N0, which means no regional lymph node metastases are present.
4. The metastasis (M) is classified as Mx, which means distant metastases cannot be assessed.

According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a pT3 classification and no regional lymph node metastases (N0) would correspond to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
46,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The tumor size is 5.0 cm, which corresponds to T2a (tumor > 3 cm but ≤ 5 cm).
* The tumor has invaded the mainstem bronchus and has perineural invasion, but the bronchial margin is free of tumor.
* There is metastatic carcinoma in regional lymph nodes, with 6/9 peribronchial lymph nodes and 1/1 parenchymal lymph node involved.
* There is no evidence of distant metastasis.

Based on the TNM classification, the tumor can be staged as:

* T2a: Tumor > 3 cm but ≤ 5 cm
* N2: Metastasis in ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes
* M0: No distant metastasis

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, the stage corresponding to T2a, N2, and M0 is Stage IIIA.

Therefore, the answer is -

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor type is squamous cell carcinoma, and the histologic grade is poorly differentiated.
2. The tumor size is 1.8 cm, which is relatively small.
3. All surgical margins are free of tumor, indicating that the tumor has not invaded the surrounding tissue.
4. There is no lymphatic or venous invasion.
5. The lymph node examination reveals 6 lymph nodes, but none of them are involved with cancer (0/6).
6. The TNM staging is pT1a, pNO, pMX, which indicates:
	* pT1a: The primary tumor is 1.8 cm in size, which corresponds to T1a.
	* pNO: No lymph nodes are involved with cancer.
	* pMX: The presence of distant metastases cannot be assessed (MX means ""cannot be assessed"").

Based on the TNM staging, the patient has a T1a primary tumor, no lymph node involvement (N0), and no distant metastases (M0). According to the AJCC staging system, this corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
49,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer:

1. The report mentions ""THE CARCINOMA INVOLVES THE PLEURAL SURFACE"", which indicates that the tumor has invaded the visceral pleura (T2).
2. The report states that ""ALL OTHER SURGICAL MARGINS OF RESECTION ARE NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR"", which means that the tumor has not invaded the surgical margins (R0 resection).
3. The report mentions that ""ONE (1) HILAR LYMPH NODE AND ASSOCIATED FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR"", which indicates that the hilar lymph node is negative for tumor (N0).
4. The report also mentions that two other lymph nodes (Station 5 and L11) are negative for tumor, which further supports the N0 status.

Based on the above findings, we can determine the TNM stage as follows:

* T: T2 (tumor invades the visceral pleura)
* N: N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis)
* M: M0 (no distant metastasis, not mentioned in the report)

According to the AJCC staging system, a T2N0M0 corresponds to Stage II.

50,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions a poorly-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma in the left upper lobe of the lung, with a maximal dimension of 37mm.
2. There is no evidence of pleural invasion, blood vessel invasion, lymphatic permeation, or perineural permeation.
3. The tumor is at least 25mm deep to the closest pleural surface and at least 30mm from the bronchial resection margin.
4. The peribronchial lymph nodes show sinus histiocytosis and contain carbon pigment, but no metastases are present.
5. The summary section of the report states the pathological stage as T2N0Mx.

Based on the AJCC staging system, a T2 tumor is defined as a tumor larger than 3 cm but not larger than 5 cm in greatest dimension. Since the tumor is 37mm in maximal dimension, it falls into the T2 category.

The N0 designation indicates that there are no regional lymph node metastases, which is consistent with the report's finding of no metastases in the peribronchial lymph nodes.

The Mx designation indicates that distant metastases cannot be assessed.

Therefore, the overall stage of the cancer is Stage II, which corresponds to a T2N0Mx designation.

Therefore, the answer is -

51,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor size is 4 X 3 X 3.5 cm, which is a significant size, but we need to consider other factors to determine the stage.
2. The histologic type is squamous cell carcinoma, which is a type of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The histologic grade is moderately differentiated, which doesn't provide significant staging information.
3. The tumor extent is not specified, which means we can't determine if the tumor has invaded surrounding structures or not.
4. There is no information about other tumor nodules, lymph nodes, lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, or margins, which are all important factors in determining the stage.
5. Since there is no information about lymph node involvement or distant metastases, we can't determine if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.

Based on the available information, the tumor size is the only factor that can be used to determine the stage. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a tumor size of 4 cm or larger is classified as T2. Since there is no information about lymph node involvement or distant metastases, the stage is likely to be Stage I or Stage II.

However, without more information, it's difficult to determine the exact stage. Therefore, based on the available information, I would choose the most likely option, which is:

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor (T) is described as a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, 28 mm in maximal dimension, with no blood vessel, lymphatic, or perineural invasion. This corresponds to a T2 tumor, as it is larger than 20 mm but not larger than 30 mm.

2. The lymph nodes (N) are involved, with squamous cell carcinoma present in one of the lymph nodes (specimen 8). This indicates N1 disease, as the tumor has spread to ipsilateral peribronchial and/or hilar lymph nodes.

3. There is no evidence of distant metastases (M), as all the lymph nodes examined show reactive changes only, except for one lymph node with squamous cell carcinoma.

Based on the TNM classification, the patient has a T2N1MX cancer, which corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
53,"## Answer

The patient's pathology report indicates that the tumor is 4 cm in size, which corresponds to a T2 classification according to the TNM staging system. The tumor does not involve the visceral pleura, and there is no lymphovascular space invasion. The pleural, bronchial, and vascular margins are free of tumor. Additionally, no metastatic carcinoma is seen in 11 peribronchial lymph nodes, which corresponds to an N0 classification. There is no mention of distant metastases, so the M classification is Mx (unknown).

Based on the TNM classification, the patient's cancer stage is determined by the combination of T, N, and M classifications. In this case, the patient has a T2N0Mx classification, which corresponds to Stage II.

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor is located in the right lower lobe of the lung, and it's a squamous cell carcinoma.
2. The tumor size is 3.0 X 3.0 X 3.0 cm, which corresponds to a T1b tumor (since it's ≤ 4 cm in greatest dimension).
3. However, the report mentions a ""satellite tumor"" which upgrades the tumor stage to T3.
4. There is no visceral pleural invasion, and the tumor appears confined to the lung.
5. Lymphovascular space invasion is suspected, but not confirmed.
6. The tumor distance from the bronchial margin is 2.0 cm, and from the pleural surface is less than 0.1 cm.
7. No lymph nodes contain metastatic carcinoma (0/2).

Considering the above points, the revised pT stage is pT3NO.

According to the AJCC staging system, a pT3 tumor with no lymph node involvement (N0) corresponds to Stage II.
