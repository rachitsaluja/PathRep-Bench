Same as above. Clinical History. Same as above. Gross Description: Received in a single container labeled. wedge. resection left upper lobe. The specimen consists of a wedge. resection of the lung measuring 9 x 6 x 1.5 cm. The pleural surface. is yellow to red tan and slightly anthracotic. On sectioning reveals. a circumscribed white tan firm nodule measuring 2 cm in greatest. dimension that is 0.1 cm from the pleural surface and extends 1 cm. from the resection margin. A representative section was examined at. the time of surgery. Received with the specimen are cassettes. labeled. Representative sections are submitted as. follows: A frozen section, B shaved resection margin, C through F. additional sections from nodule. Microscopic Description: The slides labeled are examined. See diagnosis. Final Diagnosis. Lung, left upper lobe (wedge biopsy) : Adenocarcinoma: moderately differentiated. measuring 2.0 cm in greatest diameter. extending up to but not through pleura. tumor identified within endothelial lined lymphovascular space. areas of fibrosis. lymph nodes: No lymph nodes resected (see comment). PAS 9. SPC-A. CPT: 88307, 88331. Comments. The frozen section diagnosis is confirmed. In some areas dense fibrosis is present associated with the tumor. Although the adenocarcinoma grows along alveolar spaces, the areas of. fibrosis remove this from the differential diagnosis of a. bronchoalveolar carcinoma. The tumor focally extends up to the. pleural surface but does not extend into the pleural surface. This test has been finalized at the. Campus.

Clinical History/Diagnosis: Right Renal Mass. Source of Specimen(s): 1: Right kidney. 2: Portion of right adrenal. Gross Description: Received in two parts. Source of Tissue: 1. Labeled #1, ""right kidney"". Gross Description: Received fresh in a container labeled ""right kidney"". It consists of a. right kidney weighing 850. grams and measuring 15.0 x 11.0 X 10.5 cm. The kidney is markedly. distorted from numerous bulging areas and it is grossly enlarged. Superiorly at the hilum is some residual adrenal gland measuring 1.5 X 1.0. X 0.6 cm that is otherwise unremarkable. Also at the hilum are a few tan. to brown rubbery to firm nodes measuring from 0.7 up to 1.5 cm. The nodes. have tan to brown cut surfaces. A segment of ureter measures 6.0 X 0.3 cm. and is grossly unremarkable. Also at the hilum the vessels are. unremarkable however, there is multiple bulging areas from the kidney. Perinephric fat is only present in a few areas ranging from 0.1 up to 0.5. cm. Some of the fat that is overlying some of the nodules will be. submitted for histological impression. Elsewhere, the capsule overlying. the presumed tumor nodules are inked black and will be submitted in. relationship to the kidney lesion. The specimen is bivalved disclosing a. yellowish-orange soft tumor measuring 12.0 x 9.0 x 9.5 cm comprising. approximately 80% of the kidney. The tumor markedly distorts the calyceal. system and is pushing into the renal pelvis and capsule. No gross. invasion into the aforementioned areas is identified. Fresh tissue was. prepared for. in the mass there is. some white fibrous possible scar and an appreciable amount of hemorrhage. The adjacent uninvolved parenchyma has slight scarring and well-defined. cortical-medullary junctions. Representative sections are submitted in. 1A-P. Designation of Sections: 1A- ureter and vascular margins, 1B- tumor in. relationship to renal pelvis, 1C-1D- tumor in relationship to capsule, 1E-. center of tumor, 1F- tumor in relationship to adjacent uninvolved kidney. parenchyma, 1G- tumor overlying fat, 1H- residual adrenal gland, 1I-1J-. lymph nodes K-1P- additional section of tumor. Source of Tissue: 2. Labeled #2, ""portion of right adrenal"". Gross Description: Received fresh labeled,. portion of right adrenal"" is a 6 gram, 5.0 x 2.2 x 0.8 cm portion of. adrenal gland. It is sectioned to reveal golden-yellow-orange unremarkable. cut surfaces. Representative sections are submitted in two blocks. Designation of Sections: 2A-2B. Summary of Sections: multiple. Final Diagnosis: 1. Right kidney and adrenal gland, nephrectomy and partial adrenalectomy: - Renal oncocytic neoplasm, 12 cm, confined to renal parenchyma (see. note). - Vascular and ureteral margins, free of tumor. - Adrenal gland, no tumor seen. - Seven lymph nodes, no tumor seen (0/7). Note: Immunohistochemical stains show the tumor is positive for E-Cadherin. (membranous staining), many cells positive for CK7, and weakly positive. for Vimentin, whereas negative for CD10, CK903, and CD117 (only. cytoplasmic staining). Special stain colloidal iron shows many cells with. strong, granular cytoplasmic staining. Mucicarmine special stain is. negative. Differential diagnosis includes low grade chromophobe carcinoma. versus atypical Oncocytoma. Cytogenetic study is pending, and the result. may assist the differential diagnosis. 2. Portion of adrenal, completion of adrenalectomy: - Adrenal gland, no tumor seen. Procedures/Addenda. FC Cytogenetics Solid Tumor. Results-Comments. CYTOGENETIC ANALYSIS REPORTS. DIAGNOSIS: Right Renal Mass. KARYOTYPE: Normal male karyotype: 46,XY[20]. RESULTS: The renal mass was harvested after thirteen days in culture. The chromosomes from twenty metaphases were counted and analyzed, and. three of these metaphases were karyotyped by G-banding. The modal. chromosome number was 46, and the cells appeared to have a normal. karyotype. These normal results may reflect an overgrowth of normal. interstitial tissue rather than tumor. Procedures/Addenda. Addendum. Addendum Diagnosis. The cytogenetic analysis. reveals a normal. karyotype. The histomorphology is that of an atypical oncocytoma, however, foci of. the tumor are strongly positive for colloidal iron, and many cells are. positive for CK7. Thus, an oncocytic neoplasm with low malignant. potential is favored, which is a borderline neoplasm between oncocytoma. and chromophobe carcinoma.

HISTORY. (R) pneumonectomy for malignancy. MACROSCOPIC. Four specimens received: 1: The specimen is labelled 'right lung' and consists of a right pneumonectomy measuring 215 mm. superior to inferior, 180 mm anterior to posterior and 60 mm medial to lateral in the inflated state. On. the pleural surface of the medial aspect of the lower lobe there is an area of puckering abutting the hilar. resection margin measuring approximately 70 x 40 X 55 mm. On sectioning, a pale poorly-defined. firm mass is present in the lower lobe extending from the bronchus and hilar resection margin and. measuring 50 X 45 x 70 mm. The tumour is 4 mm to the closest bronchial resection margin and up to. 2. mm from the interlobar fissure, 25 mm from the lateral pleural surface and appears to involve the. pleura on the medial aspect of the lobe. No other lesions are noted in the upper or middle lobes, the. lung parenchyma appearing normal. Please note the lung has been sampled for research. [Bronchial. margin and pulmonary artery margin, 1A; hilar resection margin, 1B-C; bronchial resection margin,. 1D; tumour and medial pleural surface, 1E; tumour and bronchus, 1F; tumour to interlobar fissure, 1G;. tumour, 1H; tumour and lung parenchyma, 1I; normal lung tissue lower lobe, 1J; normal lung tissue. middle lobe, 1K; normal lung tissue upper lobe, 1L; peribronchial lymph nodes, 1M-O]. 2: The specimen is labelled ""hilar lymph node' and consists of a piece of dark brown tissue measuring. 11. X 4 x 5 mm. [Wrapped, BIT, 2A]. 3: The specimen is labelled 'subcarinal lymph node right' and consists of a piece of pale firm tissue. covered in fat measuring 38 X 32 X 24 mm. On sectioning, there are five lymph nodes within the tissue,. the largest measuring 26 X 12 X 10 mm. [Large lymph node, 3A-C; 1 lymph node bisected, 3D; 2. lymph nodes bisected, 3E]. 4: The specimen is labelled 'upper medial sternal node (right)' and consists of a piece of fatty tissue. containing a lymph node measuring 20 X 9 x 10 mm. [Bisected and BIT, 4A]. MICROSCOPIC. 1: Sections show a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. In areas, there is production of. abundant mucin by the tumour cells. A small micropapillary component is identified. Numerous. psammoma bodies are identified within the tumour. The lesion is arising in the region of the hilum and. is invading into soft tissue around bronchi and large pulmonary vessels. A separate deposit measuring. 1.4 mm is identified in the random sections from the lower lobe and there is a deposit measuring 0.7. mm in diameter in the random sections from the middle lobe. Carcinoma is identified in the random. sections from the upper lobe but this is in a lymphangitis carcinomatosa pattern. Pleural invasion is not. identified. There is no blood vessel invasion but there is prominent lymphatic permeation is seen. No. perineural permeation is identified. Lymphatic permeation by carcinoma is identified within the. lamina propria of the bronchial resection margin. Tumour approaches the hilar resection margin. In. most areas carcinoma is separated from hilar tissues that in visceral pleura but in some areas the lung. has been transected. In one area in particular, tumour is approximately 0.5 mm from the diathermied. margin. Peribronchial lymph node metastases are seen. All the lymph node Cross sections appear to. contain at least some tumour and there is lymphatic permeation within the surrounding soft tissue. The. lung shows evidence of mild centriacinar emphysema that is best seen within the upper lobe. 2-4: Sections show focal to extensive involvement of the lymph nodes by metastatic adenocarcinoma. SUMMARY. 1-4: Right lung and hilar, subcarinal and upper 'medial sternal' lymph nodes: A: Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma; 70 mm in maximal dimension. B: Prominent lymphatic permeation but no blood vessel or perineural invasion present. C: Lymphatic permeation at the bronchial margin; tumour very close to hilar soft tissue margin; no. definite pleural invasion identified. D: Peribronchial, hilar, subcarinal and upper ""medial sternal' lymph node metastases. E: T4N2M1. F: Non-neoplastic lung: Lymphangitis carcinomatosa; mild emphysema. T-28000 M-81403 P1-03000.

The. tumour is associated with disruption of the ciliary body. processes and with a detachment of the retina. It is pigmented and consists of a mixture of cells, both. epithelioid and spindle cells, with a dominance of the. former cell type. The melanoma cells are immunoreactive for. MelanA, CD117 and HSP-27 (score 1) The number of mitoses is. approx. 21/40 high power fields. The microvasculature of the melanoma is prominent, and. closed loops are present in the tissue planes evaluated. The. lymphocytic infiltrate within tumour is minimal. Macrophages. are scattered throughout the tumour in a moderate. density. There is no evidence of scleral invasion or of. extraocular growth. The optic nerve is tumour free, and. demonstrates mild atrophic changes. The examined vortex. veins are free of tumour. FINAL DIAGNOSIS. Choroidal melanoma of epithelioid cell type. COMMENT.

The first container A is labeled A and abdominal nodule rule out METS and consists of a yellow-tan nodule measuring 1.0% 1.0 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is bisected. One-half of the specimen was examined at the time of surgery. The specimen is subsequently entirely submitted in. cassettes. no as follows: frozen section-1; remainder of specimen-2. B. The second container B is labeled. and left lobe fiver and consists of a portion of liver measuring 15.0: x 11.0 x 7.0 cm and weighs 393. grams. The surface is gray to red-tan with areas of hemorrhagic adhesions. There are multiple gray-tan nodules measuring from 1.0x 1.0 x 0.7 cm to. 11.0 x 10.0 x 2.0 cm. The nodules appear to involve approximately 90% of the liver parenchyma. The surgical resected margin has been inked. There. are surgical clips present at the surgical margin surrounding are two possible ducts. One of the possible duct appears to have tumor protruding through. the lumen and is visible at the surgical margin. On sectioning the cut surface is paie tan fleshy multilobular with areas of hemormhage. There is also an. ares of fibrous bands surrounding yellow-tan firm tissue. The mass appears focally less than 0.1 cm from the resected margin in the previously. mentioned area of possible duct. There is a rim of normal liver parenchyma that is yellow to brown-tan. Attached to one edge of the liver is a portion of. Microscopie image and dingrass, if presect, are a symbolic representation of the key findiags of this case.

The surfaces shows marked cautery artifact. The two larger pieces have been bisected and the specimen is entirely. submitted in cassettes 11. follows: small fragment-1; second fragment bisected-2 third fragment bisected-3. INTRA-OPERATIVE CONSULTATION: FSA: 'Negative for malignancy. fibrous tissue, inflammation' per. MICROSCOPIC'EXAMINATION. Section A, labeled ""abdominal nodule"" shows an area of fat necrosis with fibrosis. No metastatic malignancy is identified. Sections of the wedge biopsy of the left lobe of the liver, specimen B, shows multiple expanse isle nodules consisting of cords, nests, and trabecular. structures of a large cell malignant neoplasm having the architectural and cytologic characteristics of hepatocellular carcinoma. The tumor celis have. large vesicular nuclei with prominent nucleoli, with scattered intranuclear cytoplasmic inclusions, and a moderate to large amount of pink, granular. cytoplasm. Scattered mitoses are easily identified and there are occasional bi and multinuclested tumor cells with bizzare giant nuclear forms. These. features are in sharp contrast to the adjacent normal liver. There is evidence of vascular invasion by the tumor. Tumor appears present at the inked. surgical margins. A battery of immunohistocherical stains shows the tumor cella staining with CAM5.2 and focally with cytokeratin 20. A CD10 is done. on blocks B3, 4, 7, and 8 and shows prominent staining of bile canalículi. A polycional CEA is uninterpretable as it is over stained. The tumor cella are. immuno negative with S100 pratein, Melan-A, cytokeratin 7, alpha-fetoprotein, and Hepar antigen. Control slides stained appropriately. Additionally,. a. reticulin stain performed on block 83 shows an absence of reticulin in the tumor, in contradistinction to its presence in the adjacent normal liver. Section c shows a gallbladder with mild chronic cholecystitis. There is no morphologic evidence of malignancy, either primary or metastatic. Sections from specimen D. labeled ""additional left lobe of liver"" disclosed nodules of hepatocellular carcinoma in a fibrous stroma. Iron stains show. stored iron. Trichrome stains highlight a number of thickened fibrous trabeculas coursing through the tumor. A reticulin stain shows a general lack of. reticulin within the tumor proper. Page: 2 of 2.

Diagnosis: A: Kidney, right, laparoscopic right radical nephrectomy. Procedure: laparoscopic radical nephrectomy. Laterality: right. Histologic tumor type/subtype: Renal cell carcinoma, chromophobe. type, eosinophilic variant. Immunostains/special stains show the following results: - BER EP4: positive. - CD117: negative. - CD15: negative. - RCC: negative. - CK7: strongly positive. - E-Cadherin: strongly positive. - Colloidal iron: positive. Sarcomatoid features: not identified. Histologic grade (if applicable) : 3. Tumor size (greatest dimension) : 8.7 cm. Tumor focality: unifocal. Extent of tumor invasion (if present specify if macroscopic or. microscopic) : Capsular invasion/perirenal adipose tissue: not identified. Gerota' S fascia: uninvolved with tumor. Renal sinus: tumor invades into renal sinus adipose tissue. Major veins (renal vein or segmental branches, IVC) : free of. tumor. Ureter: free of tumor. Venous (large vessel) : not identified. Lymphatic (small vessel) : not identified. Histologic assessment of surgical margins: Gerota' S fascia (nephrectomy) : margins uninvolved with tumor. Renal vein (nephrectomy) : margins uninvolved with tumor. Ureter (nephrectomy) : margins uninvolved with tumor. Adrenal gland: not present in specimen. Lymph nodes : none present in specimen. Pathologic findings in non-neoplastic kidney: none. AJCC Staging: pT3a. pNx. This staging information is based on information available at. the time of this report, and is subject to change pending. clinical review and additional information. Comment: We note that the core biopsy of this tumor was interpreted as. renal oncocytoma. This excision specimen has much more tissue to. examine, and shows the eosinophilic variant of chromophobe. carcinoma. This variant of chromophobe carcinoma has granular,. eosinophilic tumor cells without the punched out nuclear. halos of usual chromophobe carcinoma. Eosinophilic variant of. chromophobe carcinoma may look very similar to oncocytoma in a. small sample. The immunostains and the colloidal iron results on. this excision specimen are very typical of chromophobe. carcinoma, with the exception of the negative CD117. The. entire immunostain/colloidal iron profile along with the. morphology strongly supports the interpretation of chromophobe. carcinoma. The tumor involves the renal sinus adipose tissue. Grossly, the tumor extended into the perinephric fat, but. microscopically the bulge into the perinephric tissues is. covered by renal capsule, so capsular invasion is not. identified.

Addandad Report. Resident: Pathologis. PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS: SPECIMEN LABELED ""RIGHT HEMICOLECTOMY"": MUCINOUS ADENOCARCINOMA (~508 mucinous component), MODERATELY. DIFFERENTIATED (3.0 cm in greatest dimension). Tumor is located in the cecum/ascending colon, forms a polypoid mass, is. ulcerative and has an infiltrating border. Tumor invades through muscularis propria and into pericolonic adipose. tissue. Proximal, distal and radial resection margins are negative for tumor. Invasive tumor is 9.9 cm from proximal resection margin, 9.5 cm from. distal resection margin, and 7.2 cm from radial resection margin. Lymphovascular invasion is not identified. Venous invasion is not identified. Perineural invasion is not identified. Peritumoral lymphoid response (including Crohn's-like infiltrate) is. mild. Residual adenoma is absent. REGIONAL LYMPH NODE (POSITIVE/TOTAL) : Zero (0) / thirty (30). One (1) separate adenoma. Mural pigment consistent with tattoo site. Associated diseases include diverticulosis. Appendix and terminal ileum with no significant pathologic change. AJCC Classification. T3 NO MX. NOTE: Levels examined on block A5. CLINICAL DATA: History: None given. Operation: None given. Operative Findings: None given. Clinical Diagnosis: Colon cancer. TISSUE SUBMITTED: A/1. Hemicolectomy. GROSS DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name, unit. number, and ""#1. Right hemicolectomy"", and consists of a portion of terminal. ileum (2.2 x 2.8 cm), and attached cecum and ascending colon (20.3 cm in length. x. 4.5 cm in diameter), and attached appendix (5. x 0.8 cm), a 3.2 cm proximal. resection margin, and a 2.8 cm distal staple resection margin. An ulcerated. mass (3.0 x 2.2 x 0.5 cm) is present in the cecum/ascending colon, 6.5 cm. distal to the ileocecal valve, 9.9 cm from the proximal stapled resection. margin, and 9.5 cm from the distal staple resection margin. Approximately 15. other mucosal ridges (polyps) are present in the ascending colon, measuring 0.2. to 0.5 cm in greatest dimension, and they may actually represent hyperplastic. folds of mucosa. Representative sections of normal mucosa and tumor are. submitted for tissue bank. Radial margin is 7.2 cm from the mass. Occasional. diverticula are present, with impact of fecaliths. An area of submucosal. tattoo pigment is identified 1.8 cm proximal to the mass. Micro A1: Proximal resection margin (en face), 1 frag,. Micro A2: Distal resection margin with diverticulum (en race), 2 frags,. Page: 1 of 2. Micro A3: Appendix tip, 2 frags,. Micro A4: Appendix cross sections, 2 frags,. Micro A5-A7: Mass, 1 frag each,. Micro A8: Tattoo site with mucosal polyps, 3 frags. Micro A9-A10: Mucosal fold/polyps, 3 frags each,. Micro A11: 1 lymph node, 2 frags,. Micro A12-A19: 4 possible lymph nodes each, 4 frags each,.

By his/her signature below, the senior physician certifies that he/she. personally conducted a microscopic examination (""gross only"" exam if so stated). of the described specimen (s) and rendered or confirmed the diagnosis (es). related thereto. Addendum: Upon re-review of this case, there is a focus of possible invasion into a. venule outside of muscularis propria. In that focus, a tumor cell nest is. surrounded by discontinuous smooth muscle cells, which probably represent. residual venular wall. Addendum #1 by. Addendum #2: This primary tumor is still classified as T3. The focus mentioned in the. previous addendum is suspicious for extramural venous invasion. Addendum #2 by. Page: 2 of 2.

HISTORY. Large right upper lobe tumour. MACROSCOPIC. Six specimens received: 1: The specimen is labelled ""middle and upper right lobe"" and comprises right upper and middle lobe,. received fresh, and measuring 160 X 60 X 60 mm. There is a marked degree of pleural puckering and. indrawing over the postero-lateral surface of the upper lobe. The pleura overlying the middle lobe. appears normal. A stapled margin, 65 mm in length, is present above the hilum. The bronchial. resection margins and vascular resection margins show no evidence of tumour. Peribronchial lymph. nodes are black and soft. Transverse slicing reveals a somewhat ill-defined tumour mass, 47 mm. in. diameter, within the postero-lateral aspect of the upper lobe extending almost to the pleural surface and. extending to within 10 mm of the bronchial resection margin. The surrounding lung parenchyma. appears consolidated and yellowish in colour. The main tumour mass is pale grey to cream in colour. with focal carbon pigmentation. The remainder of the lung parenchyma shows no pathological. features. Towards the apex of the upper lobe there is a second contiguous lobulated tumour mass, 30. mm in diameter, which also appears clear of the pleura. This has a more tan cut surface. [1A, upper. lobe bronchial resection margin and peribronchial lymph nodes; 1B, middle lobe bronchial resection. margin and peribronchial lymph nodes; 1C-E, tumour with overlying pleura; 1F, central tumour; 1G, 2. representative TS of additional tumour mass towards apex; 1H, uninvolved lung parenchyma from. middle lobe; 11, tissue adjacent to bronchus]. 2: The specimen is labelled ""pulmonary vein lymph node"" and comprises an irregular portion of fatty. and anthracotic soft tissue, 25 X 10 X 5 mm. [BIT, 2A]. 3: The specimen is labelled ""pulmonary vein lymph node No. 2"" and comprises fragments of. anthracotic soft tissue, 20 X 10 X 5 mm in aggregate. [BIT, 3A]. 4: The specimen is labelled ""No. 10 lymph node"" and comprises two fragments of soft anthracotic. tissue, the first 5 mm in greatest diameter, and the second 15 X 15 X 7 mm. [BIT, the larger fragment. after bisection, 4A]. 5: The specimen is labelled ""right middle lobe lymph node"" and comprises an irregular fragment of. soft anthracotic tissue, 20 X 8 X 5 mm. [BIT, 5A]. 6: The specimen is labelled ""No. 4 lymph node"" and comprises a lymph node with surrounding fat,. overall size 20 X 15 X 8 mm. The lymph node is 12 X 8 X 5 mm. [BIT after bisection, 6A]. MICROSCOPY. 1: Sections show a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma has areas of mucinous. and papillary differentiation. The contiguous nodule has a similar appearance and it is considered that. these represent part of the same tumour. The main lesion is invading into an area of subpleural. elastotic scarring. Although no convincing pleural invasion is identified within the sections, special. stains will be performed. The other component also abuts the pleura but there is no pleural invasion. Blood vessel invasion is present but no lymphatic or perineural permeation is seen. The mass is well. clear of the bronchial resection margin but there is squamous metaplasia with severe dysplasia at the. middle lobe bronchial resection margin. No lymph node metastases are seen. The uninvolved lung. shows no specific abnormality. 2: Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes only. There is no evidence of malignancy. 3: Sections of the lymph node fragments show reactive changes only. There is no evidence of. malignancy. 4: Sections of the lymph node show reactive changes only. There is no evidence of malignancy. 5: Sections of the lymph node show reactive changes only. There is no evidence of malignancy. 6: Sections of the lymph node show reactive changes only. There is no evidence of malignancy. SUMMARY. Right upper and middle lobes and lymph nodes: 1: Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of right upper lobe; approximately 47 mm in maximal. dimension. 2: Blood vessel permeation identified but no lymphatic or perineural invasion present. 3: No convincing pleural invasion identified but special stains being performed; clear of bronchial. margin. 4: No lymph node metastases. 5: T2N0MX. 6: Squamous metaplasia with severe dysplasia at right middle lobe bronchial resection margin. SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT. Some of the tumour cell nuclei stain strongly with TTF 1 in keeping with a pulmonary primary. SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT. No pleural invasion is identified with special stains.

Material examined: Mediastinal squamous epithelium. Clinical diagnosis and question. Bronchial carcinoma left upper lobe, attempted angioplasty upper lobe, discontinuation with central tumor in. REPORT ON FINDINGS. Macroscopy. 1.) Mediastinal squamous epithelium: 0.6 cm hard pale brownish specimen. Inflated, fixed left lung measuring. 17 x 12 cm at the base and up to 27 cm high, central bronchus resection plane located 3 cm proximal to the. bifurcation of the upper lobe bronchus. A staple suture line runs from the hilus in a ventrocaudal direction over. the upper and lower lobes for 7.5 cm in each case and dorsal over S2 and 6 for 6.5 cm in each case, evidently. corresponding staple suture lines. Main bronchus largely skeletonized. At the hilus four partly lesioned, mobile. blackish nodes between 0.4 and 0.8 cm. Resection margin of pulmonary artery shows high-grade lesion. Apical. and lateral region over S1, 2 and 3 shows a 16 x 14.5 cm area of parietal pleura that shows predominantly. extensive adhesion and marginally loose attachment in parts. Ostium of upper lobe bronchus constricted by a. central moderately firm, pale brown to whitish tumor, max. 4.9 cm in size, in the upper lobe, with a. predominantly relatively clear and arcuate demarcation and patchy grayish-black pigmentation in parts. Extension of tumor right up to hilar resection surface, where 1.5 cm is questionably part of the pericardial sac,. which is not macroscopically infiltrated. Involvement of some grayish-black nodes up to 1.5 cm in size by the. tumor. Narrowing of numerous blood vessels and questionable wall infiltration of an already patent pulmonary. artery branch of the upper lobe, with not tumor tissue discernible in the lumen. In S3 at the junction with S3. laterally below the section of parietal pleura is a 3.5 cm hemorrhagic zone, partly with a clear demarcation,. extending to the pleura. Peripheral bronchi of the upper lobe in parts slightly dilated and filled with thick. mucus, rest of parenchyma of the upper and lower lobes inconspicuous. From the bifurcation of the bronchus. into the basal lower lobe bronchi, three blackish nodes between 0.4 and 0.7 cm. In the subpleural region in S6 at. the junction with S8 a 0.3 cm flat blackish node. 3.) Repeat resection material from pulmonary artery: irregular portion of pulmonary artery measuring 3.7 x max. 1.3 cm. 4.) Interlobar LN (station 11): 0.7 cm lesioned node. 5.) Pulmonary ligament LN (station 9): 0.6 cm node with surrounding tissue. 6.) Paraesophageal LN (station 8): 0.6 cm node with surrounding tissue. 7.) Paraaortic LN (station 6): two lesioned grayish-black nodes or node parts, 0.8 and 0.4 cm. 8.) Low paratracheal LN (station 4) left: 1 cm node with surrounding tissue. 9.) Low paratracheal LN (station 4) right: 0.4 cm node. Examined: Re 1.) Rapid section remains,. Re 2.) a: Tumor with rest of parenchyma, b: tumor with ostium of upper lobe bronchus and involved nodes as. well as central blood vessels, c: tumor with pulmonary artery upper lobe branch, d: tumor with hilar resection. surface (color-marked), e: tumor with questionable portion of pericardial sac (resection margin color-marked),. f: hemorrhagic zone, g: pleural adhesion zone in S1, h: central bronchus resection plane and resection margin. pulmonary artery, i: mobile hilar nodes and resection margin pulmonary veins, j: node subpleural and at the. bronchus bifurcation of the lower lobe,. Re 3.)-9.) All material (in 3. preparation lamellated),. 16 blocks, partly Elastica-van Gieson, PAS, diastase-PAS. Microscopy. Re 1.) Immediate intraoperative evaluation. ): squamous cell carcinoma. Description of histological and cytological findings omitted for capacity reasons. EVALUATION. Primary diagnosis/diagnoses: Locally advanced, central, bronchopulmonary, histologically poorly differentiated, large-cell and. polymorphocellular, nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma of the left upper lobe of the lung (G3). Tumor. classification according to this picture pT4 pN1 V1 RX(R1?), stage III. C34.M8070/3. Secondary diagnosis/diagnoses: Tumor necroses. Active resorptive alveolar and lymphofollicular interstitial inflammation in the lung. parenchyma adjacent to the tumor. Lung tissue necrosis with marginal organizing and fibrous remodeling. process under the pleural adhesion area in S1. Fresh hemorrhagic pulmonary infarction in the boundary region. of S1/S3. Fibrinous pleuritis and pleural adhesions. Moderate anthracotic pigment deposits in the lung. parenchyma and varying degrees of partly mixed dust pigment deposits in the lymph nodes with reactive. accumulation of macrophages. Remark/addendum: The carcinoma shows partially endobronchial growth as far as the ostium of the upper lobe, continuously. metastasized to local bronchopulmonary lymph nodes with invasion via the mediastinal pleura into the. mediastinum, where it reaches the resection plane in places. This finding explains the pT4 classification,. although the evidently co-resected layer of parietal pericardium is not reached or infiltrated by the tumor. The. precondition is thus also met for the R1 category. If this area is directly followed by the preparation registered. under 1.), which is likewise marginally occupied by tumor, a category of R0 may also be diagnosed. Large. pulmonary vessels are only surrounded, but not invaded by tumor. The resection margins of the main bronchus,. the large pulmonary vessels, the lower lobe of the lung and all other lymph nodes are tumor-free.

A total of 50 cells were scored. FINDINGS: FISH was performed on paraffin embedded tissue sections using the. Vysis ALK Break Apart Probe for the ALK gene at 2p23 (. FDA approved). When a rearrangement involving ALK is. present, either inversion or translocation, one of the two fusion. signals separates as one red and one green signal. In this. specimen, separated signals were present in 0% of the nuclei scored. This result is within the normal limits. COMMENTS: Three to four copies of ALK were observed in 26.0% of. cells. This gain of intact ALK fusion hybridization signals. represents an aneuploid population with extra copies of chromosome. 2/2p ALK region. Additional copies of ALK are not uncommon in. NSCLCs, although the significance of extra copies of the ALK gene in. lung carcinoma is unclear at this time (Salido M. et al. J Thorac. Oncol. 2011;6:21-27). References: (1). Soda M, et al.

SPECIAL PROCEDURES: INTRA - OPERATIVE CONSULTATION: 1. Lung, right middle lobe: wedge resection (FS). - Invasive adenocarcinoma. Intra-Operative Consultation #1 performed by. Final Diagnosis performed by. ADDENDUM #1 FOR MOLECULAR TESTS: KRAS, EGFR and ALK FISH were sent on. The test is to be performed on tissue from case. The case report, slides, and blocks for the cited. accession number were retrieved from archives. The pathologist whose. signature appears below reviewed the original pathology report,. examined candidate H&E slides, and selected block 1A appropriate to. the specifications of the ordered molecular analysis. x1 H&E and x9. unstained slides were prepared and forwarded to. where the subject molecular test will be performed. An. addendum report will be issued when the results of this molecular. test are available. Addendum #1 performed by. ADDENDUM #2: MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY. KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS. Body Site: Right middle lobe of lung. Specimen Type: Slides. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: Wild-type gene. INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene. COMMENT: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor. prognosis, and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor. therapies in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS. mutations occur in 15-30% of NSCLC patients and are strongly. associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history. This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;. based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are. expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of. the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low. percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated. for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in. fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In. particular the test performance has been established in samples of. colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma which harbor. these mutations, although several other tissues are also known to. harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary,. appendix, etc.). Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide. additional information regarding this patient's probability of. response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if. clinically indicated. See references. METHOD/LIMITATION: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single. nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;. primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. REFERENCES: NSCLC. Mascaux C, Iannino N, et al.

Addendum #2 performed by. ADDENDUM #3: EGFR Mutation Analysis. Body Site: Right middle lobe of lung. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: No mutation detected. INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified in the sample provided. for analysis. Fewer than 5% of non-small cell lung carcinoma. patients without identifiable mutations are reported to be. responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies. COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal. for this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 70% tumor. cellularity upon pathologist review. A frequently occurring sequence change 2361>GA (Q787Q) was. identified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical. significance. Mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth. factor receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with. differential responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase. inhibitor (TKI) therapies. The objective response rate among. patients with a sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%. This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;. based on the current literature, most mutations in non-small-cell. lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons. Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be. detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change. during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this. result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation. in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor. This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The. clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types. is unknown. METHOD: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by. bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. REFERENCES: 1. Azzoli CG, et al.

HISTORY. Frozen section. Right lower and middle lobectomy. (L) nodes hilar. Lung Ca. MACROSCOPIC. Three specimens received: 1: The specimen is received fresh for frozen section and is labelled 'arterial margin' and consists of a. piece of muscular artery wall measuring 15 X 4 X 1 mm. No abnormalities are apparent. [BIT for. frozen section, 1A]. FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS. No evidence of malignancy. Result phoned to. on the. 2: The specimen is labelled 'right lung lower and middle' and consists of the right middle and lower. lobes as stated. The lower lobe measures 155 x 100 x 40 mm and the middle lobe 135 x 90 x 30 mm. There is a stapled resection margin along the middle lobe, 150 mm in length. A rounded endobronchial. tumour plug extends to the bronchial resection margin, however there is no attachment to the bronchial. wall in this region. The pleural surface appears indurated and tethered on the anterior apical part of the. lower lobe over an area approximately 25 x 30 mm. Sectioning reveals a tumour within the apical. segment of the lower lobe measuring 50 x 45 x 45mm with endobronchial extension up to a distance of. 40mm. The entire lesion measuring approximately 75mm in maximal dimension. The endobronchial. plug of tumour extends to involve the proximal portion of the middle lobe bronchus and is focally. tethered to the wall at this point. The alveolated parenchyma of the middle lobe appears clear of. tumour and no tumour is present at the stapled resection margin. The endobronchial plug of tumour. also extends up the bronchus to the bronchial resection margin. However, as mentioned previously the. tumour is not attached to the bronchial wall in this region. A peribronchial lymph node appears to be. involved by tumour, possibly by direct extension. The bronchial and peribronchial resection margins. appear macroscopically clear of the tumour. Localised bronchiectasis is present distal to the. endobronchial tumour plug. [2A, 5 hilar lymph nodes; 2B, bronchial resection margin en face; 2C-D,. LS to inked peribronchial resection margin; 2E, tumour plug; 2F, RS tumour plus at branch of. bronchus intermedius; 2G, RS of attachment of tumour plug; 2H, RS tumour extending into bronchus;. 2I, RS tumour and attachment of tumour plug; 2J, branching of bronchus intermedius with. peribronchial tumour and involved peribronchial lymph nodes; 2K, RS tumour and pleural surface; 2L,. RS lower lobe uninvolved; 2M, RS middle lobe uninvolved]. 3: The specimen is labelled ""No. 7 node' and consists of two pieces of fibrofatty tissue, 35 x 23 x 13. mm and 25 X 24 x 6 mm. Within both pieces of tissue there appears to be a lymph node, 24 mm and 34. mm in maximum extent. [3A-B, first lymph node bisected; 3C-D, second lymph node bisected]. MICROSCOPIC. 1: Paraffin sections confirm the frozen section diagnosis of an elastic walled artery with no evidence of. tumour. 2: Sections reveal a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma involving the apical segment of the. right lower lobe with extensive endobronchial extension. The tumour does not invade the visceral. pleura. The bronchial resection margin is clear of tumour. Tumour extends into peribronchial. connective tissue adjacent to the resection margin but is 0.3mm clear of the peribronchial resection. margin. Within peribronchial connective tissue in this region perineural permeation by tumour is. identified. The involved nerve measures 350um in diameter and in the section examined is 1.3mm. clear of the peribronchial resection margin. Lymphatic invasion is identified. Some small blood. vessels show evidence of recanalisation, however no unequivocal vascular invasion is seen. A. peribronchial lymph node is involved by tumour, possibly by direct extension. Peribronchial lymph. nodes also show evidence of sinus histiocytosis, carbon pigment deposition, fibrosis and scattered. flecks of birefringent material consistent with silicate. Within adjacent lung parenchyma there is. bronchiectasis with mucoid plugging and focal endogenous lipoid pneumonia consistent with. obstructive pneumonitis. The section of right middle lobe alveolated lung parenchyma shows. bronchiectasis with mucoid plugging, however no tumour is identified. Rare mixed duct macules are. present within the remaining alveolated lung parenchyma which is otherwise unremarkable. 3: Sections of the lymph node show reactive changes with sinus histiocytosis, follicular hyperplasia,. carbon pigment deposition, fibrosis and scattered flecks of birefringent material consistent with silicate. No tumour is identified. SUMMARY. 1-3: Right lower and middle lobes, separately submitted No. 7 lymph node: Poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma involving the apical segment of the right lower lobe. Tumour size 75mm in maximal dimension. Extensive endobronchial extension by tumour, endobronchial tumour attached at origin of right middle. lobe bronchus (macroscopic finding). Visceral pleura not involved. Resection margins clear of tumour. Perineural permeation by tumour within peribronchial tissue adjacent to margin (see microscopic. description). Lymphatic invasion present. No vascular invasion seen. Peribronchial lymph node involved by tumour, no tumour in separately submitted No. 7 lymph node. Pathological stage: T2 N1. Bronchiectasis and focal endogenous lipoid pneumonia in adjacent lung parenchyma. T-28000 M-80703 P1-03000.

Histopathology Report. HISTORY. Left lower lobe; L/N 10; Bronchial Ca left lower lobe; patient has mild. pulmonary fibrosis. MACROSCOPIC. Two specimens submitted. 1. The first specimen is labelled `left lower lobe' and consists of a lobe of. lung measuring 125 x 80 x 65 mm. No parietal pleura is included. The visceral. pleural surface shows focal puckering of the lateral surface. The area of. puckering measures 25 mm in diameter. Several enlarged hilar nodes are. identified. They measure between 15 mm and 30 mm in diameter. Serial slicing. shows a solitary, ill-defined subpleural tumour measuring 24 x 10 x 22 mm. It. is located immediately beneath the area of pleural puckering, and is 33 mm from. the bronchial resection margin. The non-neoplastic lung shows extensive. dilatation of the subpleural airspaces toward the apex. Some of the dilated. airspaces measure up to 35 mm in maximum diameter. Toward the base, there is. diffuse firmness of the lung parenchyma, which is associated with grey. discolouration. [1A, shave bronchial resection margin; 1B, shave vascular. resection margin; 1C-1D, composite section of tumour and associated puckered. pleura; 1E-1F, composite section of full face of tumour and its relation to the. pleura; 1G, rep TS of tumour; 1H-1I, 2 rep TS of apical lung showing. extensively dilated airspaces; 1J, rep TS of basal lung showing the firm grey. area; 1K-1N, hilar lymph nodes (1 node per block).]. 2. The second specimen is labelled `left no 10 lymph node' and consists of two. fragments of brown to black tissue measuring 16 x 8 x 7 mm and 9 X 6 x 6 mm. Each of the fragments is bisected. [BIT, 2A.]. MICROSCOPIC. 1: Sections show a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. The tumour. is subpleural and measures 27mm in maximum dimension [1G]. Pleural invasion is. identified [1G]. There is no vascular invasion or lymphatic permeation is. seen. No perineural invasion is identified. The lesion is well clear of the. bronchial resection margin. There is metastatic carcinoma within all the. identified hilar lymph nodes, with some of the lymph nodes showing transected. tumour deposits at the margins. The adjacent lung shows evidence of emphysema. and fibrosis with a usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP)-like pattern. Fibrosis. is most pronounced in the base of the lobe, where there is honeycomb change. with fibroblastic foct. 2: The No. 10 lymph node does not show evidence of metastases and contains. carbon pigment and birefringent material consistent with silica. SUMMARY. 1&2. Lung, left lower lobe and lymph nodes: - Poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma; 27mm in maximal dimension. - No lymphatic invasion, blood vessel and perineural invasion. - Pleural invasion identified; clear of bronchial margin. - Metastatic carcinoma in hilar lymph nodes. - No evidence of malignancy in No 10 lymph node (Specimen 2). - T2a N1 [AJCC 7th ed]. - Non-neoplastic lung: Emphysema, fibrosis with UIP-like pattern.

SPC-A. Comments. The histologic sections of the neoplasm demonstrate a poorly. differentiated non-small cell carcinoma composed of large. pleomorphic cells with large nuclei demonstrating irregular nuclear. contours. In areas, the cells demonstrate smooth chromatin; in other. areas, the nuclei appear more vesicular. The cells are arranged in. groups and clusters including large sheet-like growth patterns. Rare. pseudoglandular-like structures are noted. Occasional cells appear. vacuolated. To better characterize this neoplasm, a limited panel of. immunohistochemical stains is performed (with working controls). The. cells are strongly positive for CK5/6 and positive for CK7. The. majority of the nuclei are positive for p63 (greater than 75%). Occasional nuclei (approximately 10%) appear positive for TTF1. The histologic and immunohistochemical features of this neoplasm. have overlap between both adenocarcinoma as well as squamous cell. carcinoma. In areas, features histologically compatible with. squamous cell carcinoma are seen. In other areas, however, features. of adenocarcinoma are present. Clinical correlation is recommended. At the request of the undersigned pathologist, these slides have. been additionally reviewed by. who concurs with the. diagnosis. This test was developed and its performance characteristics. determined by. It has not been. cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The. FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. This test is used for clinical purposes. It should not be regarded. as investigational or for research.

The larger piece is bisected. 1A - submitted in toto. 2. The specimen container labeled with the patient S name and as ""lobar. ST12"", contains a large black lymph node measuring 1.0 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm. received in 10% buffered formalin. 2A - bisected and submitted in toto. 3. The specimen container labeled with the patient S name and as ""left. lower lobe - bronchial resection margin"", contains a lobe of lung that. measures 15.5 x 14. x 5.7 cm in formalin-inflated state. The pleura is. intact, mostly smooth and partly hemorrhagic. On the medial aspect. adjacent to the bronchus there is ragged soft tissue adhered. On the. medial anterior aspect extending from the apex to the inferior aspect. there is a staple line margin measuring 14.0 cm long. The bronchial. resection margin is examined at intraoperative consultation by frozen. section. On sectioning the lung, there is a central tumor mass present. measuring 4.7 cm in maximum diameter. The mass is solid tan-white with. some gray-black query segmental lymph nodes admixed. Grossly the tumor. appears to extend beyond the pleura and into the overlying ragged area of. soft tissue which is adjacent to the bronchus. In this area the soft. tissue is painted with silver nitrate. The tumor invades into the lobar. bronchus and into the segmental bronchi. The tumor is also 2.0 cm away. from the staple line resection margin. The rest of the lung parenchyma. ranges from unremarkable to mildly emphysematous with more prominence at. the apex. Four pieces of tumor and four pieces of grossly normal lung. prenchyma are taken for tissue banking. A. - bronchial resection margin, frozen section resubmitted. 3B-3D - tumor with overlying ragged soft tissue. Page: 2 of 4. 3E, 3F - tumor with invasion into lumen of bronchus and ?segmental lymph. nodes admixed. 3G, 3H - grossly normal lung parenchyma away from tumor. 3I - shaved staple line resection margin closest to tumor. - one possible lobar lymph node measuring 0.7 cm. 4. The specimen container labeled with the patient s name and as. ""completion left pneumonectomy bronchial resection margin"", contains a. lobe of lung received in 10% buffered formalin. It measures 17.5 x 13. 0. x. 4.5 cm in its formalin-inflated state. The pleura is intact, smooth and. shiny. The main stem bronchus is cut long measuring N 3.0 cm and is. tent and unremarkable. Along the medial aspect adjacent to the bronchus. there is a staple line which measures 16.0 cm long from the apex to. inferior aspect. Several black lobar and interlobar lymph nodes are. identified, the largest 0.8 cm in diameter. On sectioning the lung, no. lesions are identified. The parenchyma is mostly normal appearing with. very mild emphysematous changes present at the periphery. Several black. segmental lymph nodes are identified. The bronchial resection margin is. examined at intraoperative consultation by frozen section. 4A - bronchial resection margin, frozen section resubmitted. 4B - three lobar lymph nodes. 4C - one lobar lymph node bisected. 4D - ?one interlobar lymph node. 4E - three segmental lymph nodes. 4F - ?one bisected subsegmental lymph node or peripheral nodule measuring. 0.8 cm in diameter. 4G - thickened firm area of vessel. 4H-4J - lung parenchyma. 4K left lower lobe bronchial resection margin at main stem bronchus. 4L, 4M main stem bronchus serially sectioned transversely. 4N vascular resection margin. 5.

PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS: LEFT KIDNEY, NEPHRECTOMY (210.5g) : RENAL CELL CARCINOMA,/ clear cell type, 4.2 cm, involving lower pole, Fuhrman. nuclear grade II (of IV). Tumor is confined to the kidney. Soft tissue margin of resection is negative for tumor. Renal vein, renal artery, and ureteral margins are negative for tumor. No lymphovascular invasion present. AJCC Stage (6th edition) : Tlb NO MX. REGIONAL LYMPH NODES, BIOPSY: Four lymph nodes with no tumor present. EVALUATION OF NON-NEOPLASTIC KIDNEY (NEPHRECTOMY SPECIMEN) : KIDNEY WITH MINOR, NON-SPECIFIC ABNORMALITIES, INCLUDING MILD FOCAL GLOBAL. GLOMERULOSCLEROSIS (4% OF TOTAL GLOMERULI). ARTERIAL AND ARTERIOLAR SCLEROSIS, MILD TO MODERATE. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION. The sample consists of kidney cortex and medulla. There are up to one. hundred ninety six (196) glomeruli present in the sample submitted for light. microscopy. Eight (8) glomeruli are globally obsolescent (sclerosed). The. preserved glomeruli show normal cellularity and reveal no significant. pathological changes. Very mild mesangial expansion and occasional reabsorption. granules are recognized. On PAS and. silver methenamine stain, the. glomerular basement membranes appear of normal thickness. Tubules are well. preserved; occasional tubules are mildly distended and show few hyaline casts. The interstitium shows minimal fibrosis and mononuclear inflammation. Less than. 5% of the sample shows tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis, as evidenced. on the trichrome stains (AFOG) Arteries and arterioles reveal mils to. moderate sclerosis of the wall, with focal hyalinosis and mild signs of. vasoconstriction in the arteriolar walls. The non-neoplastic kidney was evaluated by. Renal Pathology. CLINICAL DATA: History: with incidental finding of (L) renal mass. Operation: Not specified. Operative Findings: None given. Clinical Diagnosis: Not provided. TISSUE SUBMITTED. A/1. (L) kidney - FS. B/2. Regional nodes.

KRAS Exon 1 mutation IS IDENTIFIED (Gly12Cys). B. EGFR Exon 19 mutation NOT identified. C. EGFR Exon 21 mutation NOT identified. Note: KRAS codon 12/13 mutations are found in approximately 10-30% lung adenocarcinomas and associated with history of. smoking (1). EGFR exon 19 and 21 mutations are present in about 10% of non-Asians and up to 40% in the Asian. population, common in non-smokers and associated with the tumor response to treatment with EGFR inhibitors (2). These mutations are mutually exclusive and their presence may have prognostic and/or therapeutic implications (3,4). Sample Preparation and Gene Sequencing Analysis. For cytology samples, extraction of DNA was performed from the fluid or sample provided. For surgical specimens, tumor microdissection was. performed. DNA was isolated using standard laboratory procedure. Optical density readings were obtained. For the detection of mutation, DNA. was amplified with primers flanking exon 1 in the KRAS gene and exons 19 and 21 of the EGFR gene. Then, forward and reverse sequencing. was. performed using the BigDye Terminator Kit on AB/3130 (Applied Biosystems). The known hotspots were analyzed for the presence of mutations. with Mutation Surveyor V3.01 (SoftGenetics). Addendum. TM. PROBE: Vysis LSI EGFR SpectrumOrange/ CEP 7 SpectrumGreen Probe. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization studies performed on the adenocarcinoma shows a ratio of EGFR gene to the centromere of. chromosome 7 of 1.2 indicating no EGFR amplification in the targeted region. The rate of hyperploidy for the centromere of. chromosome 7 was 26% of the analyzed cells. The signal to nucleus ratio (SNR) for the EGFR gene was 2.5. Interpretation guidelines for EGFR Gene Copy Number by FISH: Ratio of EGFR to the centromere of chromosome 7: Less than 2.0: No EGFR amplification. Greater than 2.0: EGFR amplification. Hyperploidy: Greater than two centromere copies/cell. SNR: The average number of EGFR signals per analyzed cell within the targeted region. Clinical studies show high EGFR gene copy number by FISH analysis to be associated with favorable clinical benefit (clinical. response, stable disease, time to progression, and survival) in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with. EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. CASE SYNOPSIS: SYNOPTIC DATA - PRIMARY LUNG TUMORS. TUMOR LOCATION: Right Lower Lobe. PROCEDURE: Lobectomy. TUMOR SIZE: Maximum dimension: 6.0 cm.

HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT. Sex: M. Date Collected: Date Received: Date Printed: SPECIMEN DETAILS. Specimen A. Parietal pleura. Specimen B. Parietal pleura tumour. CLINICAL INFORMATION. Epithelioid mesothelioma T2 HO MO. MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION. Specimen A Parietal pleura. An irregular piece of cream coloured tumour measuring 8 x 3.5 x 2 cm. 4 in 4 + reserve. Specimen B Parietal pleura tumour. Several pieces of white, firm tumour tissue with attached adipose tissue and adherent clot, in aggregate. measuring 18 x 16 x up to 3 cm. Some of the pieces include overlying pleura. 4 x representative sections + reserve. MICROSCOPIC REPORT. Specimens A & B Parietal pleura tumour. Samples from both specimens reveal thickened pleura, extensively infiltrated by epithelioid tumour with a. predominantly papillary architecture. The epithelioid tumour cells exhibit a moderate degree of pleomorphism. and possess vesicular nuclei with small nucleoli and a moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm. Focal. areas of tumour necrosis are present. Some of the sections include a small amount of adherent lung. parenchyma, which in areas shows reactive changes with organising pneumonia. Focally there is evidence of. infiltration of the visceral pleura. Immunohistochemistry - The tumour is positive for MNF116 and calretinin (cytoplasmic and variable nuclear. staining), shows patchy staining for WT1, focal weak staining for CK5/6 and diffuse membranous positivity for. EMA. Very focal staining for BerEP4 is noted, but most of the tumour is negative for this marker, as well as. TTF1. The appearances are those of epithelioid malignant mesothelioma.

Examination report. Macroscopic findings: 1. Parietal pleura: excised material, one with a diameter of max. 5 and one with. a diameter of 4 mm. 2. (a-i) Left inferior pulmonary lobe: resected lobe weighing 277 g and. measuring 180 X 120 x 70 mm with moderate mesh-like anthracosis of the pleura, hilar staple sutures and an. exposed bronchial stump measuring just under 10 mm. Next to this, individual, swollen lymph nodes with. anthracotic pigment but no suspicion of a tumor. In S 6 there is grayish-white tumor infiltration, well-. demarcated around the edge, measuring a good 40 mm, extending up to the outer pleura, with central, post-. necrotic-pseudocystic resorption featuring small lesions, and grayish-yellow, fragile, infiltrated, inflammatory. pulmonary tissue. In B6, no discernible tumor infiltration or destruction in the central branches examined. Immediately next to the tumor there is an inflammatory, adherent section of lung (from the middle pulmonary. lobe?), closed in by the base clip, measuring 15 mm, and without any discernible tumor infiltration. Other than. the tumorous and pneumonic infiltration on laminated sections, no further focal findings. 3. L 12: bipartite, pale lymph node tissue with anthracotic pigment, measuring. just under 10 mm together. 4. (a-b) L 11: segmented lymph adipose tissue with anthracotic pigment,. measuring 25 mm together, also displaying blood coagulation in between (complete embedment). 5. (a-b) L 9: bipartite lymph adipose tissue, measuring just under 20 mm. together. Nodes with anthracotic pigment and unremarkably imposing (complete embedment). 6. L7: bipartite lymph adipose tissue, measuring 10 mm together. 7. L 4: node with anthracotic pigment and adipose tissue, measuring 10 mm. 8. L 3: adipose tissue measuring 10 mm, with an unremarkable node measuring. 5 mm and with anthracotic pigment. Microscopic findings: 1. (HE) In the instantaneous section and the subsequent paraffin embedment,. pleura biopsy with knotty sclerohyalinosis with slit-shaped dehiscences between the thickened, collagen fiber. bundles. Base lymphoid infiltration and slight subpleural adipose connective tissue. 2. (HE, f: PAS, e to h: EvG) The central bronchial amputation border has a. bronchial wall with a regular structure, as does the peribronchial soft tissue. Next to this and further towards the. central and hilar section there are lymph nodes with anthracotic pigment build-up and moderate histiocytosis as. well as slightly lymphatic hyperplasia and small scarred areas. The tumor described comprises mesh-like. infiltrative, growing structures of a pluriform, partly keratinizing, partly severe pleomorphic cell and squamous. cell carcinoma with a clearly misaligned nucleoplasmic ratio, coarsening of the chromatin and prominent. nucleoli and frequent mitosis. Extensive necrosis in the center of the tumor, with pseudocystic transformation,. with concomitant stromadesmoplasia and lymphoid and lymphofollicular infiltrates in the tumor periphery. Extension to the perifocal, reactive, fibrosed pleura with fibrinous exudate which is no longer fresh; the base. membrane of the pleura, with fragmented, elastic membrane here, is, however, not infiltrated. Hemangioinvasion in the tumor center with a formation of obliterative tumor thrombi. Next to the tumor there. are several confluent alveolar cavities with a build-up of granulocytes and foam cell macrophages, fibrinous. exudate and finally confluent, sprouting mesenchyme buds as well as expanded bronchia with mucus permeated. by a large quantity of leucocytes. 3. (HE) Tumor-free lymph node tissue with lymphofollicular hyperplasia, with. activated germinal centers, sinus histiocytosis and marked anthracosis. 4. Similar to 3. 5. Similar to 3. 6. Similar to 3. 7. Similar to 3. 8. Similar to 3. Diagnosis: Resected left inferior lobe 1. to 8. with a centrally postnecrotically-pseudocystically transformed, poorly. differentiated and focal, keratinizing, maturing squamous cell carcinoma, measuring a maximum of 40 mm, and. located in the periphery of S 6. It extends to the still tumor-free, reactive, thickened pleura. The lobe also. displays hemoangioinvasion, and, in the peritumorous section, partly purulent, partly xanthomatous retention. pneumonia, and a tumor-free bronchial resection margin, as well as adjacent and hilar tumor-free lymph nodes. with anthracotic pigment. In samples 3 to 8 there are further tumor-free lymph nodes with anthracotic pigment. and parietal pleura with a small build-up of hyaline plaque. Tumor classification: M-8071/3, G3, pT2, pV 1, pN 0, pMX, stage IB. R 0.

Interpretation: The immunohistochemical studies highlight an. essentially normal. pattern of distribution of B cells and T cells in the lymph. nodes, with primary. follicles composed predominantly of small B lymphocytes and. a. paracortex. populated by predominantly small T lymphocytes. Morphologic and. immunohistochemical findings are compatible with reactive lymph. nodes and do not. support a diagnosis of a lymphoproliferative disorder. The mild. paracortical. expansion can be seen as a feature of dermatopathic. lymphadenopathy.

Curgical Pathology: Final. CLINICAL HISTORY: Large left breast CA with microcalcification diffusely around invasive tumor. Suggests diffuse intraductal carcinoma. GROSS EXAMINATION: A. ""Left breast mass (Af1)' "". Received is a breast biopsy specimen and frozen. section remnant. The breast tissue measures 5.0 x 4.0 x 3.5 cm. The surgeon. states that the margin is not important, thus the specimen is not inked. Sectioning of the specimen reveals a red-brown nodule measuring 3.0 x 2.5 x. 1.5 cm. Tissue from the nodule has been sent for ER/PR study. A remnant of. frozen section of the red-brown tissue measuring 1.7 x 1.3 x 0.3 cm is. submitted in toto in Block A1, with representative sections of the nodule. submitted in Blocks A2-A4. B. ""Left breast"", fresh. An 18 x 25 x 6 cm breast mastectomy specimen with a. 23 x 14 cm skin ellipse and a 12 x 9.5 cm axillary tail. The skin ellipse is notable for a grossly unremarkable nipple and areola and a. 5.5 cm recently dehised biopsy scar located in the lower medial portion of the. ellipse. The deep surface of the breast specimen is inked in black. Cut sectioning. through the breast reveals a 5 x 4 x 4 cm hollow biopsy cavity in the lower. medial quadrant which is lined by smooth white tissue in its cavity. The. cavity comes to within 0.5 cm of the inked distal surface, 0.8 cm from the. inked posterior surface, and 12 cm from the inked proximal surface. There is. a focal 1.5 x 1.5 x 1 cm firm, finely granular, grey-pink lesion located. adjacent to the lateral tip of the biopsy cavity. This lesion is, at its. closest points, 1.5 cm from the distal inked surface, 4 cm from the posterior. inked surface, 4 cm from the posterior inked surface, 11 cm from the proximal. inked surface, and 2 cm beneath the anterior skin surface. The remainder of. breast specimen is comprised of yellow-white fibrofatty tissue with an. especially prominent white fibrous focus in the upper midportion of breast. parenchyma. BLOCK SUMMARY: B1 representative section of nipple. B2-B5 tissue around biopsy cavity site which includes firm lesion described. above. B6-B7 representative sections from focal white fibrous area in upper. mid-portion of breast. B8-B9 representative sections of upper medial portion of breast.

HISTORY. ? Bronchiolo-alveolar carcinoma. MACROSCOPIC. Five specimens received: 1: The first specimen which is a frozen section is labelled ""Lung Bx, frozen section' and consists of a. wedge of lung tissue with overlying visceral pleura measuring 20 X 12 x 4 mm. Serial sections taken. through specimen. No discrete lesion identified. [BIT for FS.]. FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS: Adenocarcinoma (abuts diathermy margin). Result phoned to. [Frozen section remnants, 1A.]. 2: The second specimen is labelled with the patient's details only and consists of a left. pneumonectomy specimen. The left upper lobe measures 250 (SI) X 150 (AP) x 70 mm (ML). The left. lower lobe measures 230 (SI) x 140 (AP) x 70 mm (ML). There is an incomplete fissure on the lateral. surface of the left lower lobe. Over the lateral aspect of the pleura of the left upper lobe there is a. broad area of pallor under which the lung parenchyma is firm. This area measures approximately 140. X 110 mm. Similar subpleural firm pale areas are present throughout the lingula and are present on. both. the lateral and medial aspects of the pleura and varying in size from 3 mm up to 30 mm. At the. hilar aspect of the lung the bronchial resection margin measures 20 mm in diameter and is raised 30. mm from the surrounding tissue. A single area of pale subpleural thickening is noted in the left lower. lobe measuring 11 mm in maximum dimension. This area occurs on the anterior aspect of the left. lower lobe in the interlobar fissure. There are three areas of pleural deficiency on the left upper lobe;. one anterior and lateral measuring 30 mm in diameter and one overlying the pale area posteriorly and. superiorly measuring 30 mm in diameter where the pleura appears pulled back and is able to be laid. over the deficit. A third sutured area of pleural deficit and an underlying parenchymal defect is noted. at the postero-inferior edge of the left upper lobe laterally. This area measures 30 mm in diameter. On sectioning the lung, the majority of the left upper lobe is replaced by confluent pale tumour. measuring 165 (SI) X 120 (AP) x up to 60 mm (ML). There are numerous other deposits in the lingula. and in the most inferior aspect of the left upper lobe varying in size from 1 mm up to 20 mm. There is. extensive subpleural tumour with the large majority of the lateral aspect of the pleura appearing to be. involved by tumour. Further sectioning reveals tumour to abut the pleura on the medial aspect of the. left upper lobe adjacent to the hilum. Tumour approaches but does not appear to reach the hilar. resection margin. There is no definite tumour on the visceral pleural surface. Sectioning the left lower lobe also reveals multiple deposits of pale tumour both in superior and. inferior aspects of the lobe. These tumour deposits vary in size from 5 up to 30 mm in maximum. extent. [Bronchial resection margin, 2A; hilar lymph nodes, 2B; vascular resection margins, 2C; hilar and. peribronchial lymph nodes, 2D-2E; tumour underlying pleura and adjacent inked hilar resection. margin, 2F; tumour underlying pleura of left upper lobe adjacent to hilar resection margin, 2G; solid. area of tumour medial left upper lobe no pleura, 2H; inferior left upper lobe tumour and overlying. pleura, 2I; superior, 2J; lateral area of inferior left upper lobe in region of sutured pleural defect (?. Frozen site), 2K; lateral left upper lobe, 2L; left lower lobe inferior, two separate tumour deposits, 2M;. left lower lobe superiorly, 2N-20; uninvolved lung left lower lobe, 2P.]. 3: The third specimen is labelled ""hilar lymph node' and consists of three lymph nodes which measure. 18. X. 20 X 15 mm in maximum extent. wo bisected, 3A; third bisected, 3B.]. 4: The fourth specimen is labelled ""mediastinal lymph node' and consists of five fragments of lymph. node varying in size from 5 up to 12 mm in maximum extent and one piece of fat measuring 5 mm. [Lymph nodes bisected in toto, 4A.]. 5: The fifth specimen is labelled ""hilar lymph node' and consists of a single lymph node measuring 12. mm in maximum extent. [Bisected in toto, 5A.]. MIICROSCOPIC. 1: Paraffin sections confirm the frozen section diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. Lepidic extension of. tumour is also noted. The overlying visceral pleura is not infiltrated by tumour, Tumour involves the. diathermied margin. 2: Within the upper and lower lobes there are multiple deposits of well differentiated adenocarcinoma. which in areas show relatively extensive lepidic extension. The invasive tumour shows a predominant. papillary architecture and is composed of mucinous and non-mucinous cells. Tumour deposits abut the. visceral pleura in number of areas and there is focal visceral pleural invasion. No pleural surface. involvement is seen. There is distension of some lymphatic channels. No unequivocal lymphatic. invasion is seen. No vascular invasion or perineural permeation is identified. The bronchial resection. margin is clear of tumour. Tumour approaches to within 30um of the peri-hilar margin in an area. devoid of pleura. Although this margin is closely approached, tumour is not transected in this region. Tumour abuts the area of diathermy artefact within the upper lobe corresponding to the biopsy site for. frozen section. In a separate area, tumour abuts visceral pleura which shows diathermy artefact. precluding further assessment. Tumour infiltrates one of the lymph nodes within the hilar region. direct extension. The remaining lymph nodes are not involved. Lung parenchyma away from the. tumours shows emphysema together with foci of atypical adenomatous hyperplasia. 3-5: The lymph nodes show reactive changes with sinus histiocytosis, carbon pigment deposition and. mild follicular hyperplasia. There is no evidence of malignancy. SUMMARY. Left lung and lymph nodes (hilar and mediastinal): Well differentiated adenocarcinoma. Multiple separate lesions involving the upper and lower lobes. Largest tumour deposit 165 mm in diameter. Visceral pleura focally involved, no surface involvement identified. No unequivocal lymphatic invasion seen. No vascular invasion or perineural permeation identified. Bronchial resection margin clear, peri-hilar margin closely approached. Perihilar lymph node involved by direct extension of tumour. Remaining hilar lymph nodes and mediastinal nodes not involved by tumour. Non-neoplastic lung: Emphysema and foci of atypical adenomatous hyperplasia. Pathological stage: T4 N1 M1.

This report continues. FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT. Source of Specimen: Right Kidney nephrectomy. Clinical History/Operative Dx: Renal mass. Gross Description: The specimen is labeled right kidney and is received in formalin. It consists of a nephrectomy specimen. which together with perinephric fat weighs 478 grams, The specimen measures 14 cm from superior to. inferior, 9 cm from medial to lateral, and 7 cm from anterior to posterior. There is no adrenal gland. The. adipose tissue at the upper pole of the kidney has been stripped and disrupted. Along the anterior surface. of the kidney Is a filmy portion of pale tan tissue suggestive of Gerota's fascia measuring 8 x 4.5 cm. The. kidney is prominent bulging along the posterior and lateral surface. At the hilum, the renal artery and. renal vein are identified. The vessels are opened and there is no grossly obvious intraluminal tumor. Extending from the hilum Is a 6 cm segment of ureter which is 0.4 cm in diameter. The ureter is opened. and the urothelium is tan and smooth. There are some slight granularities in the renal pelvis. The renal. pelvis is pushed anteriorly due to the bulging tumor. The kidney is bivalved to reveal a somewhat friable,. yellow to focally brown tumor which is thinly encapsulated and does not appear to invade the perinephric. fat. It measures 9.5 X 7.5 x 6.5 cm. It abuts the renal pelvis but does not appear to invade the calyces or. renal pelvis. Representative sections of the tumor are submitted for research purposes. Away from the. tumor, the corticomedullary junction of the kldney appears distinct and cortical thickness is 0.6 cm. No. other masses are Identified. There are no lymph nodes identified in the peripelvic fat. Representative. sections are submitted.

A8) section of tumor at renal pelvis, A9) uninvolved kidney. Microscopic Description: Microscopic sections have been examined. The microscopic findings are reflected in the diagnosis. rendered. Immunohistochemistry was performed with adequate control for Vimentin, pancytokeratin, CK7,. E-Cadherin, PAX-8, and CD10. Sections show a tumor composed of solid proliferation of cells with. thickwalled blood vessels and enlarged perivascular cells. The cells are polygonal with transparent to. slightly eosinophilic cytoplasm and prominent cell membranes. The nuclei are irregular and focally. wrinkled with small nucleoli. Perinuclear halos are seen. The tumor cells are positive for CK7, E-. cadherin, PAX-8 and pancytokeratin (patchy, focal) and are negative for vimentin and CD10. Taken. together, the histomorphology and immunohlstochemistry staining pattern are consistent with. chromophobe renal cell carcinoma. An intradepartmental consultation with. was obtained.

Parts of the tumor. are highly positive for synaptophysin and NSE and negative for chromatogranin, S-100 and. CK20. Parts of the tumor are highly positive for P53. The immunohistochemical marker constellation also confirms the diagnosis of small-cell. urothelial carcinoma already communicated.

Histologic. grade: Moderately differentiated. Primary tumor (pT) : The tumor measures 6 cm. in greatest dimension,. pT2b. Central cavitation is present. Margins of resection: The pleura and vascular margins are negative. for tumor. The mucosa trimmed away from the bronchial margin and. submitted for frozen section is negative for tumor. However,. following decalcification, the complete cross section of the. bronchus (which might be slightly distal to the actual resection. margin) contains squamous cell carcinoma infiltrating the full. thickness of the bronchus. It is difficult, therefore, to. ascertain status of the actual surgical margin but carcinoma is at. least quite close. Direct extension of tumor: None identified. Venous (large vessel) invasion: Negative. Arterial (large vessel) invasion: Arterial invasion present,. supported by stain for elastic on block #3. Lymphatic (small vessel) invasion: Negative. Regional lymph nodes (pN) : In addition to the lymphoid tissue found. in parts B-H and in J-M, this right lower lobe specimen contains. five lymph nodes, one of which contains carcinoma by direct. extension. (pN1). Distant metastasis (pM) : Cannot be assessed. Other findings: There is a rare minute focus of acute. bronchopneumonia. Also, between the tumor and the pleura there are. foci of obstructive type pneumonia. J-N. Microscopic examination performed. 14x5, 15, 64x2, 16, 5x2, 4x3, 3x9, 18. DIAGNOSIS. A.

RIGHT UPPER LOBECTOMY. Clinical Details: Right upper lobectomy for carcinoma of lung. Patient has been exposed to asbestos. Four specimens submitted: 1: RIGHT UPPER LOBE. Macroscopy: The specimen consists of a lobectomy specimen measuring 170 x 70 mm with a depth of up to 80 mm. Some puckering is present over the lateral pleural surface. The tumour measures 75 x 55 x 75 mm and. abuts, does not clearly penetrate, the pleural surface. The tumour appears at least 20 mm clear of the. hilar resection margin. There is no obvious endophytic bronchial component to the tumour, although it. clearly is associated with bronchial structures. A separate small pleural nodule is identified, 45 mm. from the nearest tumour. [Bronchial resection margin, 1A; vascular resection margin, 1B; hilar lymph. nodes, 1C-1G; block 1E includes inked resection margin; pleural surface with tumour, 1H-1I; tumour. towards hilar aspect, 1J-1L; separate pleural nodule, 1M; macroscopically unremarkable lung, 1N]. Microscopy: Sections show a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with extensive central necrosis and. cavitation. A definite bronchial origin is not identified. There is no evidence of pleural invasion, and. the separate pleural nodule is shown to represent a silicotic nodule within a pleural lymph node. No. lymphatic invasion is seen, however metastatic carcinoma is present in one of the peribronchial lymph. nodes. Vascular invasion is identified. The bronchial resection margin is clear of malignancy but. shows a benign mucous gland adenoma. Lung parenchyma adjacent to the tumour shows organising. pneumonia while distant lung parenchyma shows emphysema. 2: HILAR LYMPH NODE. Macroscopy: The specimen consists of a piece of dark brown tissue, 4 x 4 x 3 mm. [BIT, 2A]. Microscopy: Sections show fragments of lymph nodes containing large numbers of pigmented macrophages but. showing no evidence of metastatic carcinoma. 3: PARTIAL BRONCHUS RIGHT SIDE. Macroscopy: The specimen consists of a portion of bronchial wall measuring 25 x 15 x 5 mm. No obvious mucosal. abnormality is identified. [Serially sectioned and all pieces blocked, 3A]. Microscopy: Sections show full thickness bronchial wall in which there is no evidence of the mucous gland. adenoma seen in the resection margin of specimen 1. However there is squamous metaplasia with. severe dysplasia which falls short of carcinoma in situ. There is no evidence of invasive malignancy. Conclusion: Partial bronchus right side: squamous metaplasia with severe dysplasia. 4: MEDIASTINAL LYMPH NODE. Macroscopy: The specimen consists of a lymph node measuring 8 x 6 x 3 mm with attached fatty tissue. [All tissue. blocked, 4A]. Microscopy: Sections show a lymph node containing numerous pigmented macrophages but showing no evidence of. metastatic carcinoma. Conclusion (Specimens 1,2 and 4): Right upper lobectomy and lymph node sampling: Poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, 75 mm in diameter. Vascular invasion is present. Metastatic carcinoma in peribronchial lymph node. No pleural invasion. Mucous gland adenoma at bronchial resection margin. Pathological stage T2 N1. T-28000 M-80703 P1-03000.

The large portion of the body of the stomach, the wall is thickened. and indurated, and the mucosa granular and congested with loss of. the normal rugal folds. No proliferative mucosal lesion is seen. There is a relatively sharp contrast with normal antral mucosa. The. fat around both lesser and greater curves, is indurated. Omentum is. included showing obvious abnormality. On slicing the thickened wall. shows some pallor. Composite longitudinal section taken from mid. portion of stomach to distal margin in blocks A1-A4. A5 & A6 also. composite blocks also representing sections to proximal margin along. lesser curve. Random section of omentum block A7. Blocks A8&A9. greater curve lymph nodes A10 lesser curve lymph nodes. X in 10 TP. b. Specimen is labelled donuts proximal oesophageal and distal small. bowel. 2 pieces of ragged tissue received in the same container, the. largest with an external diameter of approximately 17mm. Most NX in. 1P. c. Specimen is labelled right gastroepiploic nodes. Ragged piece of. fatty tissue, up to 23mm. No definite node identified. AX in 1. MICROSCOPY. a. Sections taken from the abnormal thickened area described. macroscopically showed diffuse pattern poorly differentiated. adenocarcinoma, which infiltrates through the full thickness of the. gastric wall, into perigastric fat. The cells are poorly cohesive. The minor component have a signet-ring pattern, but generally the. cells are pleomorphic, with variable quantitive cytoplasm. Tumour. extends to the gastro-oesophageal junction, where there is a small. nodule of gland forming tumour, beneath squamous epithelium. Intramucosal tumour is identified in this region, unlikely the. remainder of the stomach, where the tumour is predominantly. submucosal and intramural. Tumour extends close to the proximal. margin but does not involve it. Two (2) greater curve lymph nodes. were identified, both showing metastatic carcinoma. There is. extensive infiltration of surrounding fat by tumour. Five lesser. curve nodes were retrieved, all showing metastatic adenocarcinoma. Again there is extensive infiltration of the surrounding fat. Sections of omentum show no significant abnormality. b. Sections of proximal and distal resection rings representing. portions of oesophagus and duodenum, show no evidence of involvement. by tumour. c. Sections show fat with a single lymph node. The latter shows. extensive sinusoidal infiltration by metastatic adenocarcinoma. DIAGNOSIS. 1 & 2.

This cancer shows HER2/neu protein. overexpression (scored as 2+; see comment below) and has metastasized to right axillary sentinel. lymph node No. 1D as a roughly 1.1 mm keratin positive collection of tumor cells barely visible. by routine H&E morphology (see comment regarding right axillary sentinel lymph node excision. below). Infiltrating ductal carcinoma, Nottingham grade I (of III) [tubules /3, nuclei /3, mitoses /3;. Nottingham score /9] is identified forming a second lesion (1.7 x 1.5 x 0.9 cm) in the upper outer. quadrant located 0.6 cm inferior and medial to the first lobular carcinoma mass [AJCC pT1c]. This tumor also shows HER2/neu protein overexpression (scored as 2+; see comment below). However, there is no morphologic evidence of metastasis by this second lesion into any of the. sentinel lymph nodes. Extensive ductal carcinoma in situ, intermediate nuclear grade, is present within and outside the. invasive component with a separate nodule in the central/deep breast, 1.2 x 1.2 x 0.6 cm, located. 1.4 cm medial to the infiltrating ductal carcinoma. Angiolymphatic invasion is not seen. The. non-neoplastic breast parenchyma shows proliferative fibrocystic changes. Biopsy site changes. are present. The tumor does not involve the nipple, overlying skin, or underlying chest wall. All. surgical resection margins, including the deep margin, are negative for tumor (minimum tumor. free margin, 0.4 cm, anterior/superior margin). Lymph nodes, right axillary sentinel, excision: A single (of 12) right axillary sentinel lymph. node is positive for metastatic carcinoma [AJCC pN1 mi (sn)]. This positive sentinel node is. designated No. 1D (tissue block A4) and is characterized by a roughly 1.1 mm collection of. keratin positive tumor cells without much in the way of H&E morphologic correlation. As noted. above, this microscopic focus of cancer has lobular features. The remaining 11 right axillary. sentinel lymph nodes are negative for metastatic cancer (verified by keratin immunostaining). Blue dye is identified in right axillary sentinel lymph nodes No. 1A, No. 2A, No. 3A, No. 3B, and. No. 4. Blue dye is not identified in right axillary sentinel lymph nodes No. 1B, No. 1C, No. 1D,. No. 2B, No. 2C, No. 2D, or No. 3C. HER2/neu protein overexpression is weakly positive, score of 2+, according to the interpretation. guidelines in the FDA-approved HercepTest This degree of overexpression is seen in both tumor. nodules (using tissue blocks B2 and B4). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for. HER2/neu amplification will be performed and reported in an addendum. HER2 protein immunohistochemical (IHC) test results are only valid for non-decalcified paraffin. embedded specimens fixed in neutral buffered formalin or Bouin's fixatives. Testing is. performed using commercially available kit/reagents employing a polyclonal antibody and a. polymer-based detection system. ADDENDA: No amplification for HER2/neu is demonstrated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH,. performed in Laboratory Genetics) (blocks B2 and B4) according to the interpretation guidelines. in the FDA approved PathVysion Her2 DNA Probe Kit.

HISTORY. RLL. ? Soft tissue bronchial margin. MACROSCOPIC. Three specimens received. 1: The specimen is labelled ""right lower lobe"" and consists of a lobectomy specimen which measures. 135 mm from superior to inferior, 150 mm at the base from anterior to posterior and up to 55 mm from. lateral to medial. The pleural surface is smooth. There is a stapled resection margin superior to the. hilum. A firm nodule is palpable inferior to the hilum. Adjacent to the bronchial resection margin. there is a firm nodule which is relatively circumscribed. It measures approximately 18 mm in diameter. and on sectioning appears to represent an involved lymph node with an adjacent compressed bronchial. branch. Sectioning of the lung parenchyma reveals a large tumour mass which extends from the hilum. towards the periphery. The nodule is irregular in shape. It has a cream and grey cut surface. It. measures 55 x 50 X 35 mm and lies approximately 15 mm from the overlying diaphragmatic pleural. surface, but extends to within 3mm of the lateral pleura. Towards the hilum there is a second. circumscribed nodule which lies immediately adjacent to the main tumour mass. This nodule measures. 15 mm in diameter and may possibly represent an involved lymph node. A further suspicious lymph. node is identified within the lung parenchyma superior to the main bronchus and this measures 10 mm. in maximum dimension. There are no other focal lesions. [1A-bronchial and vascular resection. margins; 1B-peribronchial lymph nodes; 1C-large peribronchial nodule close to margin; 1D-suspicious. nodule on superior aspect of main bronchus; 1E-RS of tumour; 1F-1G tumour with overlying nearest. pleural margins; 1H-nodule adjacent to main tumour; 1I-uninvolved lung.]. 2: The specimen is labelled ""middle lobe lymphatic tissue"" and consists of a single fragment of cream. tissue which is elongated. It measures 15 x 2 x 2 mm. [BIT-2A.]. 3: The specimen is labelled ""No. 7 lymph node"" and consists of multiple fragments of black and grey. fibrofatty tissue having an aggregate measurement of 40 x 25 x up to 8 mm. Sectioning reveals. blackened lymph nodes. [The largest fragment is bisected and one half is blocked with all remaining. fragments in 3A-3B.1. MICROSCOPIC. 1: Sections show a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. The lesion is in the region of the. central bronchi and extends out towards the pleura. Pleural invasion is not identified. There is no. blood vessel invasion but lymphatic permeation is seen. No perineural permeation is identified. The. lesion is clear of the bronchial resection margin but there is a nodule of tumour within the adjacent soft. tissue. This is partly related to a lymph node and extends close to/if not at the inked resection margin. Further levels are being examined. Several peribronchial lymph node metastases are seen. There is. organising pneumonia surrounding the tumour and the adjacent lung shows evidence of emphysema. The bronchial resection margin shows squamous metaplasia with mild dysplasia. 2: Sections show an artery with surrounding fibroadipose tissue and nerves. There is no involvement. by tumour. 3: Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes only. There is no evidence of malignancy. SUMMARY. Right lower lobe lung and lymph nodes: 1: Poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma; 55 mm in maximal dimension. 2: Lymphatic permeation identified but no blood vessel or perineural invasion present. 3: No pleural invasion identified and clear of bronchial margin; soft tissue extension partly related to. a. lymph node that extends close to/if not at the hilar resection margin. 4: Peribronchial lymph node metastases. 5: T3N1MX. SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT. Deeper sections of the large peribronchial nodule close to the mediastinal margin have been examined. Carcinoma extends extremely closely to this margin. Convincing involvement is not seen but. involvement adjacent to the sections is not entirely excluded. T-28000 M-80703 P1-03000.

Pathohistological diagnosis. Seminoma testis (pT2 NXMX). Description: Testicle with cut tumor, size 8:6:5 cm, and 8 cm long funiculus was received. The tumor has. irregular edges, is white to brown in color, of medium consistency and is 8:5:4 cm in size. Histologically, the tumor is made of solid seats and tumor cell traces with round and oval. bright nuclei in which we see small nuclei and scarce, bright and pink cytoplasm. Inside the. tumor, at microscope's large visual field, we see 3-4 mitosis. Around tumor seats we find. connecting tissue containing moderately abundant lymphocyte infiltrates. Several channels. adjacent to tumor are coated with unclassified intratubular germ cell neoplasia (IGCNU). Performed imunohistochemical dying (positive PLAP in all tumor cells and in unclassified. intratubular germ cell neoplasia) with morphological examination indicates that this is a. malign testicular tumor of germ origin, seminoma. The tumor infiltrates tunica albuginea and is present in lumens of several blood vessels inside. tunica albuginea. The tumor was not detected in funiculus.

COMMENT: The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the. proportion score (0 = no staining, 1 = <1% of cells staining, 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11-30%. of. cells staining, 4 = 31-60% of cells staining, 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak. intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate intensity of staining, 3 = strong intensity of staining), with a scoring. range from 0 to 8. ER/PR positive is defined as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is defined as an Allred score. of. less than or equal to 2. Methodology: Fixation Type and Length: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. ) for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Antibody and Assay Methodology: Mouse anti-human ER and PR,. Comment: This assay can be used to select invasive breast cancer patients for hormone therapy (1). ER and PR analysis was performed on this case by immunohistochemistry utilizing the ER (ER 1D5,. 1:100) and PR (PGR 136, 1:100) antibody provided by. following the manufacturer's instructions. listed in the package insert. This assay was not modified, and adherence to all instruction and. guidelines were strictly followed. Interpretation of the ER/PR immunohistochemical staining. characteristics is guided by published results in the medical literature (1), information provided by the. reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance within the Pathology Department. 1.

RIGHT BREAST SKIN, EXCISION: - FRAGMENT OF UNREMARKABLE SKIN, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit. Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED. Clinical Interpretation of results. Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the. I. A majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17. signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no. amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used D4. Source of case: RPCI. Tissue fixation. formalin-fixed tissue. Outside Case No:NA. Tissue source. breast Results interpreted: HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.21. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-. 2/neu. gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test. FDA APPROVED REAGENT. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of. patients for whom Herceptin therapy is being considered. These tests were performed in the. under the direction. of The results of these studies should always be interpreted in the context of the. clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic diagnosis.

Final Surgical Pathology Report. Procedure. Diagnosis. Distal pancreas and spleen, excision -. Poorly differentiated pancreatic adenocarcinoma, extending into. peripancreatic soft tissues (see microscopic description) . Carcinoma extends at least near to outer resection margin, but not. definitively identified at outer margin. Proximal margin negative for. high-grade dysplasia and carcinoma (see microscopic description). Spleen without specific diagnostic abnormalities. Metastatic adenocarcinoma in one of twelve (1/12) lymph nodes. Microscopic Description: The following template summarizes the findings in this case: Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma. The specimen also has dilated ducts. lined by mucinous epithelium, including in the grossly separate cyst. submitted in blocks A3 & A4, compatible with (branch duct-type). intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) See note below. Histologic grade: Poorly differentiated. Primary tumor: pT3. Carcinoma extends into peripancreatic soft. tissues. Margins of resection: Carcinoma extends at least near to the inked. outer margin, but is not definitively identified at this margin. There. is IPMN at the proximal margin, but it appears low grade at the margin,. without high grade dysplasia or carcinoma identified at the proximal. margin. Regional lymph nodes: pN1. There is metastatic adenocarcinoma in one. of twelve (1/12) lymph nodes, with the positive lymph node in block. #14. Distant metastasis: Not applicable. Vascular invasion: Not definitively identified. Other findings: There is perineural invasion by carcinoma, including. in. areas that grossly appeared normal (block #5) The spleen is without. specific diagnostic abnormalities. Note: It is uncertain if the poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma has. arisen from the IPMN, or if the IPMN is an incidental finding in the. background. This case has been reviewed in Intradepartmental. Consultation, with essential concurrence with the interpretation, with. most reviewers favoring the IPMN is incidental. Specimen. Distal pancreas, spleen. Clinical Information. PRE-OP DIAGNOSIS: Pancreatic cancer. Gross Description. Received fresh in a container labeled ""distal pancreas, spleen"" is a. 9. x 5.5 x 3.5 cm portion of distal pancreas, which attached 110 g, 10 x. 7.8 x 3.5 cm, spleen. The surface of the spleen is gray-tan and. wrinkled, and on cut surface it is dark red, smooth, and glistening,. with diffuse white stippling, without gross abnormality. There are. a. few areas on the hilar surface of the spleen, approximately 2 cm in. greatest dimension, where the capsule is absent. The pancreas has a. stapled margin proximally. The staples are removed and this surface. is. inked black. The remainder of the surface of the pancreas is inked. blue. A firm mass can be palpated from the outer aspect of the. specimen. The specimen is sectioned, and there is a white-tan ill. circumscribed mass 4.5 x 3.7 x 2.7 cm. The mass is 3 cm from the. proximal resection margin, and 3.5 cm from the spleen. The pancreatic. duct can be traced on cut surface to the tumor, but cannot be probed. The pancreatic duct appears to be markedly stenotic and possibly. obliterated through the area of the tumor. The pancreatic duct lining. is inked green for identification purposes. There is some residual. normal appearing tan pancreatic tissue grossly identified outside of. the mass. There is an apparent cystic structure near, but not clearly. at, the proximal margin of the specimen, 0.7 cm in greatest dimension. This cyst is 0.2 cm from the pancreatic duct. There are a few tan. lymph nodes identified in the surrounding adipose tissue. RS-15,. following fixation. BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 - vascular margin; 2 - spleen; 3,4 - entire pancreatic. cyst, with block 3 including adjacent pancreatic duct margin; 5 -. grossly normal pancreatic tissue; 6-11 - tumor, including relation to. the pancreatic duct and outer margin; 12-14 - lymph nodes; 15 -. additional tissue from proximal pancreatic margin.

A-ZF-A9RN-01A-PR -. SPECIMEN. 1 Bladder, uterus, ovaries and cervix. 2 Left ureteric resection margin. 3 Right ureteric resection margin. CLINICAL DETAILS. Cystectomy for bladder cancer. MACROSCOPY. 1 - Radical cystectomy specimen with attached uterus, ovaries and anterior. vaginal wall. The bladder is approximately 90 mm diameter and has associated adipose tissue. around it. On the attached peritoneal surface there is an irregular. haemorrhagic mass approximately 15 mm diameter, suggesting extension of tumour. Opening the bladder reveals a fungating mass arising from the posterior wall and. with extensive surface necrosis. The tumour is approximately 70 mm diameter and. is attached by a broad base. In addition, the background mucosa has a 20 mm. separate mass and also two further 4 mm flattish nodules. Section through the. mass shows extension through the bladder wall to come close to the peritoneal. surface. Overall tumour thickness is approximately 40 mm. Away from the main. and smaller tumour nodules the bladder mucosa appears normal, though there is. marked trabeculation of the bladder. The urethra measures 25 mm and has normal. surface mucosa, but there is 5 mm nodule between the midpoint of the urethra and. the anterior vaginal wall. The uterus measures 60 mm supero-inferiorly, and there is no apparent. abnormality of cervix, endometrium or myometrium. The left ovary measures 20. mm, the right 18 mm, and both show senile atrophy with no further abnormality of. them or of the fallopian tubes. 2 - This is 5 mm of ureter. 3 - This is 9 mm of ureter. Block designation: Specimen 1. A = tumour peritoneum. J = background mucosa anterior. B = haemorrhagic area on peritoneum K = background mucosa. C = tumour and adjacent normal. L = urethra midpoint. D-E = composite full depth of tumour. M = urethra margin. F = tumour & background mucosa. N = cervix. G = tumour left lateral with invasion of fat O = endometrium. H = 20 mm separate nodule tumour. P = left ovary and tube. I = 5 mm nodules of tumour. Q = right ovary and tube. MICROSCOPY. 1 - The tumour is composed of extensive sheets of undifferentiated carcinoma. cells with small areas of necrosis. In addition, some areas show squamous. differentiation with keratinisation. These features would be consistent with. transitional cell carcinoma, grade 3, with squamous differentiation. Similar. tumour is seen in the main mass and in the separate nodules. The tumour invades right through the bladder wall to reach adipose tissue, and. there is also extravesical lymphovascular invasion. The haemorrhagic tissue on. the peritoneal surface is further tumour. In general the tumour seems 2 or 3 mm. clear of the peritoneal surface, but this peritoneal deposit of tumour suggests. there may be a focus with invasion, or local lymphatic spread to the surface. In addition, there is a nodule of tumour in the septum between midpoint urethra. and anterior vaginal wall. Two tiny lymph nodes in perivesical adipose tissue show reactive changes without. tumour. The usual regional lymph nodes have not been supplied. Away from the tumour, the bladder epithelium is either normal, or shows a minor. degree of glandular differentiation. The urethra mucosa and resection margin is. normal. The uterus shows no histological abnormality apart from atrophy, and the same. applies to the ovaries. 2 & 3 - These samples show normal ureters. SUMMARY. Radical cystectomy with hysterectomy; transitional cell carcinoma of bladder,. WHO 1973 Grade 3, pT3b, pNx with positive peritoneal surface. Pathologists -.

Left lung submitted fresh for tissue procurement. labelled ""left lung"" is an intact lung with two lobes. weighing 442 grams. There is a suture line present at the. amputation point of the main left bronchus, the left main pulmonary. artery and main left pulmonary vein. The pleural surface of the. lung is intact with a finely stippled anthracotic pigment present. No obvious areas of puckering of the pleura or umbilication are. evident. Several small possible peribronchial lymph nodes are. present adjacent to the bronchial stump. There is a mass that is. palpable in the interlobar fissure. This appears to be below the. surface of the lung. Sections are placed through the mass and this. reveals a large tumor mass which is immediately inferior to the main. bronchus. The tumor mass measures maximally 6 X 5 X 4 cm. It. arises approximately 1 cm below the bronchial cuff margin that. grossly does not appear to be involved by tumor.

NOTE: HER2 FISH is being performed and the results will be subsequently reported. HER2 IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY TEST DETAILS: Using appropriate formalin fixed (8 - 96 hours). controls and tissue test. block, 4B5 antibody clone is used as part of FDA approved. and. interpreted as follows: Score 0 (negative) = No staining is observed or membrane staining is observed in less than 10% of the. tumor cells. Score 1+ (negative) = A faint/barely perceptible membrane staining is detected in more than 10% of the tumor cells. The cells are only stained in part of their membrane. Score 2+ (equivocal) = A weak to moderate complete membrane staining is. observed in more than 10% of the tumor cells. This score requires reflex testing by FISH. Score 3+ (positive) = A strong complete. membrane staining is observed in more than 30% of the tumor cells. SPECIAL PROCEDURES: FISH. Interpretation. nucish(D17Z1x2-5,ERBB2x2-8)[40]. No amplification of the HER-2/NEU gene was seen by interphase FISH analysis. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was performed on a formalin-fixed Block 1H (left segmental mastectomy @ 2:00). using the DNA probe for the HER-2/NEU gene. An adequate number of invasive tumor cells were. present and evaluated by two independent observers. The ratio of HER-2/NEU signals (ERBB2) to chromosome 17 centromere. signals (D17Z1) was determined to be 1.34. A ratio of greater than 2.2 is considered to be amplified; therefore, this specimen is. not amplified. Although amplification was not seen, many of the cells exhibited 3 or more signals for both the HER-2/NEU gene. and for the chromosome 17 centromere. This may be indicative of either polyploidy or aneuploidy for chromosome 17. The. average number of HER-2/NEU signals per cell was 3.26. The average number of signals for the chromosome 17 centromere was. 2.44. Concurrent positive and negative control specimens showed the expected results. This FISH test is performed using a modification of the. FDA approved. HER-2 DNA Probe Kit (1:2 LSI HER-2/neu. / CEP17 probe : T-denhyb-2 buffer). This FISH test was developed and its performance determined by the. Pursuant to the requirements of CLIA '88, this laboratory has established and verified the test's. accuracy and precision.

Male. Specimen No. HISTOPATHOLOGY. Lab No: CLINICAL NOTES: Subtotal gastrectomy and extended right hemicolectomy for. adenocarcinoma of distal gastric region. ?spread to transverse colon. Peritoneal nodule. MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: 1. A stomach and extended right hemicolectomy connected by attached. gastrocolic omentum. The proximal gastric margin measures 60mm in. diameter and the distal margin measures 35mm in diameter. The lesser. curvature measures 120mm and the greater curvature measures 165mm. The. lesser omentum measures 35mm in width. The greater omentum measures. 170mm in width. The right hemicolectomy specimen consists of terminal ileum, 100mm in. length x 25mm in diameter, appendix 80x5mm and right colon 550mm in. length x 25mm in diameter. There is a fungating ulcerated tumour plaque in the lesser curve of the. stomach. 75x82mm, approximately 20mm from the proximal resection. margin and 40mm from the distal resection margin. Tumour is up to 18mm. thick and has penetrated the full thickness of the stomach wall to. infiltrate up to approximately 10mm into lesser omentum. There is no. macroscopic direct extension of tumour into the greater/gastrocolic. omentum, however, numerous nodules suspicious of tumour metastases are. evident within both greater and lesser omenta in the vicinity of the. stomach. The right hemicolectomy specimen is macroscopically unremarkable. A sample of fresh gastric tumour was given to. for research purposes.

P1. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: 1. Sections show a large poorly differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma. of intestinal type which extends with an infiltrating margin through. the full thickness of stomach wall into subserosal tissues and omenta. Although tumour lies immediately beneath the peritoneal surface, no. actual breach of the peritoneum by tumour is identified in the sections. examined. Tumour consists of solid cohesive masses of cells, focally punctuated. by infrequent small granular lumina. Small quantities of desmoplastic. stroma are focally associated with tumour, however, in many areas,. there is no appreciable stromal response. Individual tumour cells are large round to polygonal cells with. moderate quantities of amphophilic cytoplasm, large moderately. pleomorphic rounded nuclei, granular to irregularly clumped chromatin. and conspicuous large amphophilic nucleoli. Mitoses are abundant. There ie extensive tumour invasion of lymphatic vessels, both within. the gastric wall and within omenta. There is, additionally, apparent. focal invasion of ectatic veins within omenta. There are numerous. deposits of metastatic tumour within omenta, both within lymph nodes. and as separate nodules growing directly out of lymphatic vessels. Exact counting of these ie very difficult, however, at least 55. apparently distinct metastases are present amongst 56 lymph nodes and. omental tumour nodules (present in both lesser and greater omenta). Tumour within mural lymphatic vessels appears to have approached to. within 1. Smm of the proximal longitudinal resection margin of the. stomach, but is nevertheless completely excised in the planes of. section. Tumour appears to be well clear of the distal resection. margin. No tumour is identified within the right hemicolectomy specimen,. including 5 ileocolic lymph nodes. 2. Sections show skeletal muscle and peritoneum. No tumour is. identified in this specimen.

Report Status: Amend/Addenda. Type: Surgical Pathology. Specimen Type: Kidney, partial or total resection. Procedure Date: PATIEN: Addended Report. PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS: SPECIMEN LABELED ""RIGHT KIDNEY"": RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, clear-cell type, (2.4 cm), Fuhrman Grade II/IV. (focally III/IV), involving the mid and inferior pole. Tumor embolus is present at the renal vein margin. Tumor is confined to kidney (except for tumor emboli). Extensive tumor emboli are present in vasculature. Ureteral and arterial margins are negative for tumor. Gerota's fascial and oft-tissue margins are negative for tumor. AJCC Classification (6th Edition) : pT3b Nx Mx. The non-neoplastic kidney will be evaluated by Renal Pathology, and the. findings will be reported in an addendum. CLINICAL DATA: History: None given. Operation: Right radical nephrectomy. Operative, Findings None given. Clinical Diagnosis: Renal cell carcinoma. TISSUE SUBMITTED: A/1. Right kidney. GROSS DESCRIPTION: The specimen, Part A, is received fresh, labeled with the patient's name, unit. number, and ""#1. Right kidney"", consists of a 483-gram radical nephrectomy. specimen (overall dimensions 17.0 x 7.2 x 5.0 cm) consisting of kidney (10.2 x. 6.3 x 4.8 cm) and attached yellow/tan lobulated perinephric adipose tissue (up. to 3.5 cm in thickness) Extending from the renal hilum is a segment of ureter. 16. cm length x 0.3 cm in diameter), a segment of renal artery (1.6 cm length. x 0. cm in diameter), and a segment of renal vein (0.5 cm length x 1.0 Cm in. diameter). In the mid pole, there is a well-circumscribed golden yellow focally. hemorrhagic mass (2.4 x 2.4 x 1. cm), which grossly appears to arise from the. renal parenchyma and focally distorts but does not appear to invade into the. renal sinus. Upon, sectioning, the mass is confined to the renal parenchyma,. does not grossly appear to involve the renal capsule, and comes within 2.4 cm. of the perinephric soft tissue resection margin. Within the renal vein, there is a loosely adherent friable hemorrhagic. red/brown to yellow/brown necrotic tissue (probable tumor thrombus) contiguous. with the aforementioned mass, which grossly appears to come within 0.2 cm of. the renal vein margin (previously sampled en face in the frozen section room). The aforementioned comes within 2.4 cm of the renal artery margin and 5.5 cm of. the ureteral margin. A 0.9 cm inferior to the aforementioned mass, in the inferior pole of the. kidney, there is a well-circumscribed yellow/tan friable nodule (? satellite. lesion, 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm). The pelvic calyceal system exhibits smooth, glistening tan mucosa. The. corticomedullary junction is distinct. No lymph nodes are identified within. the perinephric adipose tissue. A representative section of. the specimen was photographed. which 7 (3.5 %) are globally. sclerosed. The remaining glomeruli show mild. diffuse mesangial expansion; overt nodular glomerulosclerosis is not noted at. this time. There are no discernible craters or double contours of the. glomerular basement membranes. Rare distal tubules contain PAS-positive. hyaline casts. Less than 5% of the cortical parenchyma shows tubular atrophy. and interstitial fibrosis. Arteries and arterioles exhibit a mild to focally. moderate degree of sclerosis; some small arteries reveal significant narrowing. of the lumen by accumulation of connective tissue in the subintima. Arterioles. show early focal hyaline degeneration. Report Status: Type: Cytogenetics. Cytogen-. KARYOTYPE: 45, XY, del (3) (p11) del (6) (q12q25) , der (9) t (7;9) (q171;q374), -21 [cp4] / 80, idem. x2 (6). METAPHASES COUNTED: 10. ANALYZED: 6. SCORED: 4. BANDING: GTG. INTERPRETATION: All metaphases contained clonal aberrations including loss of the short arm of. chromosome 3, which is a characteristic finding in renal cell carcinoma, clear. cell type. COMMENTS: Mosaicism and small chromosome anomalies may not be detectable using the. standard methods employed. Chromosome analysis was performed at a level of 400. bands or greater. INDICATION FOR TEST: RCC.

Paraffin sections confirm the frozen section. diagnosis of organising pneumonia. In areas the pneumonia has a BOOP-type. pattern. Fibrinous exudate is present on the pleural surface. There is no. evidence of malignancy. 3: Sections show a moderately to poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. The tumour shows focal clear cell change. It is subpleural and there is a. suspicion of pleural invasion in an area of pleural scarring. Fibrinous. exudate but no tumour is present on the pleural surface. Focal blood vessel. invasion is present but there is no lymphatic permeation. Many of the. pulmonary arteries show fibrous intimal thickening and focally there are. features of a previously recanalised thrombus. The vessel infiltrated by. carcinoma appears distal to this. No perineural permeation is identified. The. lesion is well clear of the bronchial resection margin but there is mild active. chronic inflammation, squamous metaplasia with moderate dysplasia. Metastatic. deposits are noted within a peribronchial lymph node. The adjacent lung shows. evidence of emphysema, organising pneumonia and nodules of luminal fibrin. 4: Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes only. There is no. evidence of malignancy. 5: Sections of the lymph nodes show extensive replacement by metastatic. squamous cell carcinoma. SUMMARY. Right lower lobe and lymph nodes: 1: Moderately to poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma; 70 mm in. maximal dimension. 2: Blood vessel permeation identified but no lymphatic or perineural invasion. present. 3: Possible pleural invasion identified, special stains being performed; clear. of bronchial margin. 4: Peribronchial and right middle lobe lymph node metastases. 5: T2N1MX.

Histopathology Report. SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT BELOW (22/2). HISTORY. LU lobectomy. Past history Hutchinson's melanotic freckle. MACROSCOPIC. Two specimens received. 1: The specimen is labelled left upper lobe' and consists of a lobectomy. specimen measuring in its partially inflated state 210 x 150 x 50 mm. Two. separate bronchi are seen at the hilum ranging in size from 10 to 12 mm in. diameter (lying approximately 30 mm apart). Surrounding the two bronchi is a. bare area measuring 55 mm in maximal diameter. A staple line is seen radiating. from the hilar to the periphery, it measures 80 mm in length. Differential. inking is as follows, the bare area is inked black and the staple line is. removed and inked blue. The pleural surface is tan to grey with a diffuse area. of induration over the lateral lower aspect of the lobe extending over the. lingular, which measures 60 mm in greatest dimension. There is also scarring. over the apex measuring 15 mm in greatest dimension. The cut surface of the. lung shows a centrally based/peri-bronchial tumour measuring 35 mm in greatest. dimension. It extends peripherally to focally abut the pleural surface. (posterior lateral). Definite macroscopic invasion of the pleura is not seen. The tumour has a white firm cut surface with focal areas of necrosis. It lles. 10 mm from the closest bronchial margin. A second firm tan nodule measuring 6. mm in greatest dimension in the apical portion of the lobe. It lies 2 mm from. the pleural surface (appears to abut the pleural surface) and over 70 mm to the. bronchial margin and 65 mm from the main tumour mass. There is normal. intervening lung. The residual lung shows moderate to severe emphysema and an. area of pleurally based fibrosis adjacent to the induration over the. lingular/lateral surface. [1A, bronchial margin; 1B, hilar lymph nodes; 1C-D,. TS through tumour with 1C including closest bronchial margin and 1D showing. extension to pleura; 1E-F, RS of tumour abutting pleural surface; 1G, second. possible tumour within apical aspect of lobe; 1H, RS of normal intervening lung. between main tumour mass and smaller tumour; 11, peri-bronchial lymph nodes;. 1J, area of fibrosis over lateral/lingular pleura; 1K, RS of emphysema within. upper portion of lobe]. 2: The specimen is labelled hilar lymph node left lung' and consists of over. ten fragments of what appears to be nodal tissue ranging in size from 2 mm to. the largest piece measuring 20 mm in greatest dimension. The fragments have. a. grey black cut surface. [BIT: 2A, largest plece bisected; 2B, multiple smaller. fragments]. MICROSCOPIC. 1: Sections reveal a moderate and poorly differentiated squamous cell. carcinoma. The tumour abuts but does not invade visceral pleura. The tumour. is clear of the bronchial resection margin. Within the confines of the tumour. there is focal vascular and lymphatic invasion. No perineural permeation by. tumour is seen. Peribronchial lymph nodes show reactive changes with sinus. histiocytosis, carbon pigment deposition and scattered flecks of birefringent. material in keeping with silicate. No tumour is identified within these nodes. Immediately adjacent to the tumour there is focal change within lung parenchyma. in keeping with obstructive pneumonitis characterised by focal organising. pneumonia, mild acute alveolitis, and a few collections of intra-alveolar foamy. macrophages. Marked emphysema is present. Associated with a mixed dust macule. there is a small non-necrotising granuloma. The separately described. macroscopic lesions represent foci of scarring and organising pneumonia. No. tumour is identified within these areas. 2: Sections of lymph node tissue reveal reactive changes with prominent sinus. histiocytosis, carbon pigment deposition and scattered flecks of birefringent. material in keeping with silicate. Reactive follicular hyperplasia is also. noted. Rare tiny ill-defined non-necrotising granulomata are also seen. focally. There is no evidence of malignancy. SUMMARY. 1&2: Left upper lobectomy with separately submitted left hilar lymph node: Moderately and poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Tumour size 35 mm in diameter. No visceral pleural invasion seen. Bronchial resection margin clear of tumour. Focal lymphatic and vascular invasion present within tumour.

PROCEDURE DATE: RECEIVED DATE: REPORT DATE: Pre-Op Diagnosis. Lung mass. Post-Op Diagnosis. Same. Clinical History. Nothing indicated on requisition. Gross Description: Container labeled. - right lower lobe of lung"" is a. 206 gram portion of recognizable pulmonary parenchyma grossly. consistent with right lower lobe of lung. The specimen as received. is 16.1 x 10.5 x 5.0 cm. The margin of resection is a previously. sectioned bronchi with multiple staple lines. The pleura is. wrinkled tan gray to brown and anthracotic streaked with a few. nodular gray tan plaques up to 0.1 cm. Noted in the apparent. lateral aspect in the central portion of the specimen there is a. previously sectioned area of indurated umbilication measuring on. reconstruction approximately 2.4 X 2.0 x 1.8 cm. This has been. previously sectioned to reveal a lobulated gray tan to brown nodular. lesion which grossly appears to extend to but not through the pleura. in this area. This appears at its nearest point approximately 3.6 cm. from the nearest bronchial margin.

Lung, right lower lobe of lung (lobectomy): Tumor characteristics: Specimen integrity: Intact. Specimen laterality: Right. Tumor site: Lower lobe. Tumor size: 2.4 cm in greatest diameter. Tumor focality: Unifocal. Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma (see comment). Histologic grade: Poorly differentiated. Visceral pleural invasion: Not identified, carcinoma extends up to. but not into pleura. Tumor extension: Not identified. Treatment effect: Not identified. Lymphovascular space invasion: No unequivocal lymphovascular space. invasion identified. Surgical margin status: Bronchial surgical margin: No carcinoma identified. Pleural margin: No carcinoma identified. Distance of tumor from closest margin: Less than 1 mm from the. pleural margin. Lymph node status: One peribronchial lymph node demonstrating no metastatic carcinoma. (0/1). PAS 9. Other: Areas of subpleural fibrosis with interstitial fibrosis,. interstitial chronic inflammation. PAS 4,6. Emphysematous changes. PAS 4. Focal subpleural bone formation. PAS 4. pTN stage: pT1b NO. Level 9 lymph node, right lung (biopsy): Reactive sinus histiocytosis and anthracosilicosis, no metastatic. carcinoma identified within one. lymph node (0/1). PAS 4. Level 7 lymph node, right lung (biopsy): Reactive sinus histiocytosis and anthracosilicosis, no metastatic. carcinoma identified within one. lymph node (0/1). PAS 4. 4R lymph node, right lung (biopsy): Multiple fragments of lymph node demonstrating reactive sinus. histiocytosis and. anthracosilicosis, no metastatic carcinoma identified (see. comment). PAS 4. Level 10 lymph node, right lung (biopsy): Fragments of lymph node demonstrating reactive sinus histiocytosis. and anthracosilicosis, no. metastatic carcinoma identified (see comment). PAS 4. Right lung middle lobe (wedge biopsy): Subpleural fibrosis and foci of interstitial fibrosis. Scattered areas of interstitial chronic inflammation. Emphysematous changes. Intraalveolar macrophages. No carcinoma identified. PAS 4,6 SPC-A. Comments. This is staged as a pT1b lesion based on the size of 2.4 cm in. greatest diameter. The final stage should be performed in. conjunction with the clinical information. Sections of the tumor show a poorly differentiated large cell. carcinoma. A panel of immunohistochemical stains is performed. including CK5/6, p63, TTF1 and CK7 (with appropriate positive and. negative controls). The neoplastic cells are positive for TTF1 and. CK7. The neoplastic cells are negative for CK5/6 and p63. The. overall histologic appearance in conjunction with the. immunohistochemical stains is consistent with a poorly. differentiated adenocarcinoma. In addition, some dense eosinophilic. collagenous scar tissue is present suggesting this may have. represented a so-called scar carcinoma. The carcinoma extends up to. but not into the visceral pleura, being separated from the pleural. margin by less than 1 mm. Clinical correlation and follow up is. recommended. At the request of the undersigned pathologist, these slides have. been additionally reviewed by. who concurs with the. diagnosis. This test has been finalized at the.

Local Invasion (for renal cortical types): Not Identified. Renal Vein Invasion: Not identified. Surgical Margins: Free of tumor. Non-Neoplastic Kidney: Unremarkable. Adrenal Gland: Not involved. Lymph Nodes: Free of tumor. Number of nodes examined:5. Staging for renal cell carcinoma/oncocytoma: pT2 Tumor >7.0 cm in greatest dimension limited to the kidney. IATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE. REVIEWED AND APPROVED THIS REPORT. Gross Description: 1). The specimen is received fresh for frozen, labeled ""Left kidney, adrenal and hilar lymph nodes"". It consists of a grossly. recongnizable kidney whose appearance is markedly altered by a large mass localized to the lower pole. Attached to the upper. pole of the kidney is a portion of fatty tissue investing a grossly recognizable adrenal gland. An attached segment of ureter is. identified at the hilum. The overall measurements of the specimen are 22.0 x 14.0 x 8.5 cm. The specimen weighs altogether. 905 gm. The specimen is bivalved to demonstrate a large corasely lobulated well-circumscribed and possibly encapsulated tumor. with fleshy, homogenously pink-tan cut surface with multiple scattered small cystic areas. The tumor measures 15.5 x 13.0. x. 8.5. cm. The tumor replaces the entire lower pole of the kidney. It appears to be pushing on the renal sinus fat but does not seem to. invade it or extend into the collecting system. No macroscopic vascular invasion is noted. The tumor appears to grossly extend. into the perirenal fat but not through the gerota's fascia. The remainder of the kidney is grossly unremarkable. The adrenal gland. is. dissected off the kidney. It measures 5.3 x 2.6 x 0.9 cm, weighs 7 gm and is grossly unremarkable both from outside and on the. cross-section. The hilar fat is searched for lymph nodes. Several possible lymph nodes are dissected. Samples of tumor and. normal kidney tissue are submitted for. Gross photographs are taken. Representative sections are submitted for frozen. section diagnosis and paraffin blocks. Summary of Sections: FSC - frozen section control. M - margin. TC - tumor to capsule. TK - tumor to kidney.

Surgery Date: DIAGNOSIS: Liver, right lobe and segment 1, partial hepatectomy: Grade 3 (of 4). cholangiocarcinoma forming a circumscribed mass (3.6 X 2.9 X 2.8 cm) within. the region of the caudate lobe. Surgical margins are negative (by 0.2 cm). Liver, segment 3, No. 2, excision: Bile duct adenoma. Liver, segment 3, biopsy : Benign liver parenchyma, negative for tumor. Liver, segment 4, biopsy: Benign liver and foci of. hemosiderin-lader. macrophages. No evidence of neoplasm. Lymph nodes, hepatic artery, excision: Non-necrotizing granulomatous. inflammation. Negative for tumor. Gallbladder, cholecystectomy: Benign. gallbladder. mucosa. with. cholesterolosis. No stones are identified. No cystic duct lymph node. identified. Sections of the non-neoplastic liver show prominent non-necrotizing. granulomatous infiltrates within portal areas and the lobular parenchyma. There is no apparent fibrosis or ductopenia, and in general. the. granulomatous infiltrates do not appear to be directed at bile ducts. This. likely represents a granulomatous reaction to the patient's neoplasm. However, obtaining an AMA would be helpful to exclude PBC . In addition,. there is granulomatous inflammation within the hilar lymph nodes. GMS and. AR stains are negative. Additional clinical correlation needed to exclude other granulomatous. processes, such as sarcoidosis.

Visit #: : Service Date. Male. Soc. Sec. #: Client: FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS. A. Left Kidney, laparoscopic nephrectomy: 1. Papillary renal cell carcinoma, type 1, Fuhrman grade 2, 10cm in greatest. dimension, margins free of tumor; see comment. 2. Ureter with no tumor identified. 3. Adrenal gland with no tumor identified. B. Perirenal fat, laparoscopic nephrectomy: Adipose tissue, no tumor identified. COMMENT: This papillary renal cell carcinoma, Fuhrman grade 2, predominantly type 1, shows large areas of necrosis. (~40% of the tumor mass). Histologically the tumor is comprised of papillae with fibrovascular cores filled. with abundant foamy histiocytes (strongly CD68 positive). The papillae are lined by a single layer of low. cuboidal to columnar cells with relatively abundant cytoplasm and moderately enlarged nuclei with easily. discernable nucleoli, consistent with Fuhrman grade 2. Strikingly, the tumor cells and foamy histiocytes. show extensive granular cytoplasmic pigment, consistent with hemosiderin. There is a minor component of. solid/tubular architecture that is comprised of larger cells with granular eosinophilic cytoplasm and large. nuclei with prominent nucleoli. Given the marked hemosiderin pigment immunohistochemical stains for. cytokeratin and CD68 were necessarily performed to confirm the diagnosis. The cytokeratin strongly. stained the malignant cells while the CD68 highlighted the foamy histiocytes.

TISSUE DESCRIPTION. eived in formalin labeled ""segment 4A. liver"" is a fragment of liver measuring 3.0 x 1.4 X 1.0 cm. The. specimen is a wedge resection and triangular in shape. There is. cautery artifact on one side, the capsule is smooth and without. abnormalities on another surface, and the cut surface is golden. yellow. The specimen is serially sectioned and submitted in. cassettes A1 and A2. DIAGNOSIS: Liver, segment 4A, wedge biopsy: Fatty liver disease. characterized by marked steatosis, mildly active (grade 1 of 3). steatohepatitis, and periportal fibrosis with rare bridging. (stage 2-3 of 4). DIAGNOSIS COMMENT: This is a large wedge biopsy with numerous portal tracts,. although the cytology is distorted by moderate to marked cautery. artifact. Portal areas show intact bile ducts with mild. nonspecific lymphocytic inflammation and several bile duct. hamartomas (von Meyenburg complexes) Acinar parenchyma shows. marked, nearly panacinar, steatosis that is accompanied by only. rare ballooned hepatocytes and very spotty Lymphohistiocytic. infiltrates. There is no vell-formed Mallory's hyaline. Iron. and PAS-D stains are negative. Trichrome and reticulin stains. show only slight zone 3 fibrosis, but fairly extensive. periportal fibrosis and a rare portal-portal bridge. There is. no evidence of extensive fibrosis or cirrhosis. Addendum/Procedure included. TISSUE DESCRIPTION: Tissue from. liver (6.2 X 5.0 x 4.8 cm) . DIAGNOSIS: Liver, segment 4A/4B, resection: Hepatocellular carcinoma,. grade 3 (of 4) , forming a 3.1 X 2.5 X 1.8 cm mass. The surgical. resection margin is negative. Vascular invasion is not. identified. The section of the non-neoplastic hepatic parenchyma. demonstrates severe, predominantly macrovesicular steatosis. with a moderately active steatohepatitis and periportal and. focal bridging fibrosis (stage 2-3 of 4) Scattered non-. necrotizing portal and lobular granulomas are also seen (see. comment) . Comment: The section of non-neoplastic liver contains. numerous portal tracts for evaluation. Many of these contain. mild to moderate lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrates. Some. also contain granulomatous inflammation. The latter does not. appear to be directed at bile ducts. There is no significant. interface activity. The lobular parenchyma demonstrates severe,. predominantly. macrovesicular steatosis. Lobular inflammation, occasional. neutrophils, occasional microgranulomas, and hepatocyte. ballooning are seen. A trichrome stain confirms the presence of. periportal and focal bridging fibrosis. The iron stain is. negative for hemosiderosis. Results of GMS and Auramine-rhodamine stains will be reported. as an addendum. Given the clinical scenario, the granulomatous. inflammation may represent reaction to the patient's neoplasm. Clinical correlation is needed. ADDENDUM: Special stains for microorganisms (AR and GMS) are negative. AMENDMENTS: Revision Description: Amended to include non-. neoplastic liver component in final diagnosis. Original Diagnosis. Liver, segment 4A/4B, resection: Hepatocellular carcinoma,. grade 3 (of 4), forming a 3.1 X 2.5 X 1.8 cm mass, 0.1 cm from. the surgical margin. The surgical resection margin is negative. Vascular invasion is not identified. Evaluation of the non-. neoplastic liver parenchyma will be reported in an addendum. PRELIMINARY FROZEN SECTION CONSULTATION: Liver, segment 4A/4B, resection: Hepatocellular carcinoma. Surgical margin is negative. Non-neoplastic liver shows marked. steatosis. Defer to permanent sections for further assessment.

Final Surgical Pathology Report. Procedure: Diagnosis. Rectum with J-pouch, attached bladder and prostate, pelvic. exenteration: Recurrent poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma involving rectal. mucosa, submucosa, muscularis propria, perirectal adipose tissue and. extensively infiltrating prostatic parenchyma. Tumor is present at the right pelvic sidewall margins. The prostatic urethral margin is positive or tumor in parenchyma and. lymphatic spaces. The rectal mucosal and deep margins are negative for tumor. Extensive lymphovascular space invasion and perineural space invasion. Microscopic Description: Microscopic examination performed and summarized in the template below: Histologic type: Recurrent adenocarcinoma. Histologic grade: Poorly differentiated. Primary tumor (pT) : Although the tumor with somewhat difficult to. define grossly its microscopic spread was quite extensive with. prominent involvement of the rectum and J-pouch and connective tissue. between the rectum and the prostate and extensive infiltration of the. prostate and prostatic urethra and seminal vesicles. Overall the. recurrent tumor measured greater than 5 cm in greatest dimension. Proximal margin: Proximal rectal margin negative for tumor. Distal margins: Distal rectal margin negative for tumor. Circumferential (radial) margin: Right pelvic sidewall is. microscopically positive for tumor with areas of perineural space. invasion. Also tumor was present at the prostatic urethral margin. Vascular invasion: Present and prominent with both lymphatic and venous. invasion identified. Regional lymph nodes (pN) : 1 residual lymph node was identified and it. is negative for metastatic tumor (0/1). Non-lymph node pericolonic tumor: Present. Distant metastasis (pM) : Not evaluated. Other findings: There is some acute colitis in the rectum that is. nonspecific. There are some nonspecific findings of chronic cystitis. in the bladder. The ureter margins were negative for tumor. However. some tumor was identified attached to the left side of the bladder in. deep nerves attached seminal vesicles. MSI testing was not ordered as this is a recurrent tumor and not a. primary tumor. Specimen. Bladder prostate and rectum. Clinical Information. Recurrent rectal cancer. Recurrence between J-pouch and. prostate/seminal vesicles. Gross Description. Received fresh and subsequently fixed in formalin labeled ""bladder. prostate and rectum"" is a specimen which includes a 4.3 x 3.7 white 3.7. cm prostate, an 8.5 cm portion of rectum with J-pouch, attached bladder. and prostate. The bladder is approximately 6.5 x 5.5 and is 4.0 cm. inflated. There is a catheter in the prostatic urethra and the specimen. is heavily stapled. Orientation of the specimen was reviewed by the. surgeon at time of tissue procurement. No frozen sections were. requested. Proximal end of the rectum is inked blue and the distal end. of the rectum is inked black. The J-pouch of the specimen is. approximately 3 x 2.5 cm and is heavily stapled, located within 2.5 cm. of the distal margin of the rectum. The mucosa of this area is smooth. and glistening showing an average circumference of 7.5 cm in its opened. state. In the J-pouch there is a 1.2 x 0.7 cm ulcer. This comes within. 2.5 cm of the distal rectal margin and 6.5 cm of the proximal rectal. margin. This comes within 1.2 cm of the anastomotic line surface of. this area shows tumor present and a scarred focus. This area of the. J-pouch is adherent to the posterior right side of the prostate. This. area is inked black. The cut surface of this area shows a white tan. scarred irregular focus which is approximately 2.5 x 2.5 x 2.5 cm. The. remainder of the cut surface of the prostate is pink-tan and diffusely. nodular. The remainder of the bladder and prostate are opened in an. anterior Y-shaped incision. Mucosa the bladder is pink-tan smooth. glistening with no other discrete gross lesions identified. The ureters. are propatent an average 4.5 x 0.3 cm. The seminal vesicles cannot be. grossly identified in a variegated and behind the rectum. Vas. deferentia cannot be grossly identified. From minimal fat is gross. identified surrounding the tissue. Possible lymph nodes may be present. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted as follows: 1 -. representative luminal margins of the rectum, 2 - 6 - entire J-pouch. ulceration and to tumor including anastomotic line (inked blue) and. possible seminal vesicle and prostatic tissue, (from proximal to. distal), 7 - left side bladder with ureteral orifice and possible. ureteral margin, 7 - right side bladder with possible ureteral margin.

CORRECTED. Report Type. Date of Event. Authored by. Hosp/Group. Record Status. CORRECTED. ADDENDA: Addendum. MOLECULAR ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY TESTING: Block 3K: A. HRAS mutation IDENTIFIED (p.Q61K, c.181C>A). B. Mutations in BRAF, NRAS61, KRAS12/13 NOT identified. C. FISH test for RET/PTC rearrangement is pending. NOTE: DNA was extracted in the amount sufficient for testing. BACKGROUND: Mutations in either BRAF or RAS genes or RET/PTC rearrangements are found. in. more than 70% of papillary thyroid carcinomas (1). BRAF V600E (T1799A). mutation has been associated with more aggressive behavior of papillary. carcinoma (2,3). The association between BRAF V600E mutation and features of. tumor aggressiveness have also been observed in papillary microcarcinomas (4). Mutations in the RAS genes or PAX8/PPARg rearrangement occur in ~70% of. follicular thyroid carcinomas and with lower frequency in oncocytic (H?rthle. cell) carcinomas (5). Regarding the specificity of these mutations for cancer,. BRAF V600E mutation and RET/PTC and PAX8/PPARg rearrangements are overall. specific for malignancy in the thyroid, although they have been reported with. a very low frequency in benign thyroid lesions (6). RAS mutations occur in. malignant and benign thyroid tumors, being found in ~40-50% of follicular. and anaplastic carcinomas, 30-40% of follicular adenomas and 10-15% of. papillary carcinomas (6). 1. et al.

Recent developments in the molecular biology of the thyroid. Differential Diagnosis and Molecular. Advances. MUTATIONAL ANALYSIS: For paraffin-embedded surgical specimens, manual microdissection was performed. to collect tumor tissue. Specimens with the minimum of 50% of tumor cells in. a microdissection target are accepted for the analysis. Optical density. readings were obtained. Real-time PCR was performed on the LightCycler. platform to amplify BRAF codons 599-601, NRAS codon 61, HRAS codon 61, and. KRAS codons 12/13 sequences. Post-PCR melting curve analysis was used to. detect possible mutations. If required, the mutation type was confirmed by. Sanger sequencing of the PCR product on ABI3130. DNA from samples positive. for each of these mutations was used as positive controls. Amplification at 35. cycles or earlier was considered sufficient for the analysis. The limit of. detection is approximately 10-20% of alleles with mutation present in the. background of normal DNA.

Regional Lymph Nodes (pN). pN0: No regional lymph node metastasis. Number Examined. 11. Number Involved. 0. CLINICAL HISTORY AND PRE - OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: with a 4 cm LUL mass. MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received in four parts, each labeled with the. patient's name. 1. Part one is received fresh, labeled 'left upper lobe wedge at 084. b'. It consists of a pre-incised wedge biopsy of the lung measuring. 9 X 3.5 X 2 cm. The stapled line measures 9 cm in length. The. stapled line is shaved and the pleura around is inked black. At the. pre-incised area there is a grey-white firm nodule measuring 2 X 1.1. X 1.1 cm located 0.4 cm from the stapled line margin. The remainder. of the parenchyma is pink-red and crepitant. Frozen section. performed on the nodule and resubmitted for permanent section. Representative sections are submitted. 2. Part two is received in saline, labeled 'level 5 lymph node'. It. consists of two pieces of tan-brown soft tissue measuring 1.0 X 0.8. X 0.3 cm and 0.4 X 0.3 X 0.2 cm. Entirely submitted. 3. Part three is received fresh, labeled 'completion left upper. lobectomy'. It consists of a 176 gram left upper lobe of the lung. measuring 23 X 6.5 X 4 cm. There are two staple lines at the medial. aspect of the specimen measuring 11 cm and 11.5 cm. The staples are. removed and this margin is inked black. The pleural surface is. inked blue. The specimen is serially sectioned from superior to. inferior. There is no grossly palpable mass or lesion identified. Representative sections are submitted. 4. Part four is received in saline, labeled 'level 9 lymph node'. It consists of a piece of tan-brown soft tissue measuring 0.9 X 0.4. X 0.2 cm. Entirely submitted. SUMMARY OF SECTIONS: 1A frozen section remaining of the nodule. 1B-1E remaining of the nodule. 1F stapled line margin. 1G random section of the parenchyma. 2A in toto. 3A bronchial margins. 3B vessel margins. 3C possible hilar lymph nodes. 3D one bisected hilar lymph node. 3E-3J representative sections, including entire hilar region. 4A in toto. SPECIAL PROCEDURES: INTRA - OPERATIVE CONSULTATION: 1. Lung, left upper lobe, wedge resection: - Adenocarcinoma. ADDENDUM # 1 FOR MOLECULAR TESTS: EGFR, KRAS and ALK (FISH) was sent on. 1. for patient. The test is to be performed on tissue from case. The case report, slides, and blocks for the cited. accession number were retrieved from archives. The pathologist whose. signature appears below reviewed the original pathology report,. examined candidate H&E slides, and selected block 1C appropriate to. the specifications of the ordered molecular analysis. 1 H& E and 9. unstained slides were prepared and forwarded to. where the. subject molecular test will be performed. An addendum report will be. issued when the results of this molecular test are available. Addendum #1 performed by. ADDENDUM #2: EGFR Mutation Analysis. Body Site: Left upper lobe of lung. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: No mutation detected. INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified in the sample provided. for analysis. Fewer than 5% of non-small cell lung carcinoma. patients without identifiable mutations are reported to be. responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies. COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal. for this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 80% tumor. cellularity upon pathologist review. A frequently occurring sequence change 2361G>A (Q787Q) was. identified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical. significance. Mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth. factor receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with. differential responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase. inhibitor (TKI) therapies. The objective response rate among. patients with a sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%. This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;. based on the current literature, most mutations in non-small-cell. lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons. Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be. detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change. during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this. result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation. in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor. This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The. clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types. is unknown. METHOD: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by. bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary electrophoresis. and fluorescence detection. False positive or negative results may. occur for reasons that include genetic variants or somatic. heterogeneity of the tissue sample. DISCLAIMER: This test was developed and its performance characteristics. determined by. The laboratory is regulated under the. Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of. (CLIA) as. qualified to perform high complexity clinical testing. This. particular test is not considered a stand alone test and should be. used only in the context of other diagnostic tests or clinical. work-up related to treatment decisions. Addendum #2 performed by. ADDENDUM #3: MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY. KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS. Body Site: Left upper lobe of lung. Specimen Type: Slides. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: Wild-type gene. INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene. COMMENT: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor. prognosis, and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor. therapies in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS. mutations occur in 15-30% of NSCLC patients and are strongly. associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history. This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;. based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are. expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of. the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low. percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for. use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in fresh,. frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In particular. the test performance has been established in samples of colorectal. cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma which harbor these. mutations, although several other tissues are also known to harbor. KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix,. etc.). Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide. additional information regarding this patient's probability of. response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if. clinically indicated. See references. METHOD/LIMITATIONS. Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single. nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;. primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. This test was developed and its performance characteristics. determined by. The laboratory is regulated under. the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of. (CLIA) as. qualified to perform high complexity clinical testing. This. particular test is not considered a stand along test and should be. used only in the context of other diagnostic tests or clinical. work-up related to treatment decisions. Addendum #3 performed by. ADDENDUM 3: Fluorescence In-Situ Hybridization (FISH). Body Site: Left upper lobe of Lung. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. INTERPRETATION: Negative for a rearrangement involving the ALK gene. Probe #Nuclei Examined % Positive Nuclei %. Control values. 2p23(ALK)V 100 0 <15.0. A total of 100 cells were scored. FINDINGS: FISH was performed on paraffin embedded tissue sections. using dual color break-apart probe. to the ALK. gene at 2p23. This probe flanks the entire gene. If a rearrangement. involving ALK is present, inversion or translocation, one of the two. probe signals separates as one red (orange) and one green signal. In. this specimen, separated signals were present in 0.5% of the nuclei. scored. Based on laboratory validation data, these results are. within the normal limits. COMMENTS: Three to four copies of ALK were observed in 27.0% of. cells. This gain of intact ALK fusion hybridization signals. represents an aneuploid population with extra copies of chromosomes. 2/2p ALK region. Additional copies of ALK are not uncommon in. NSCLCs, although the significance of extra copies of the ALK gene in. lung carcinoma is unclear at this time (. ISCN RESULTS: nuc ish(ALKx3 4) [42/100]. This test was developed and its performance characteristics. determined by. It has not been cleared or.

Clinical Diagnosis & History: year old male with right renal mass. Specimens Submitted: 1: SP: Right renal tumor (fs). 2: SP: Deep surgical margin, right kidney. 3: SP: Paracaval lymph node. DIAGNOSIS: 1. SP: Right renal tumor (fs): Tumor Type: Renal cell carcinoma - Unclassified type. High grade. See comment. Tumor Size: Greatest diameter is 3.7 cm. This pertains to the largest tumor although multiple lesions are present. See comment. Local Invasion (for renal cortical types): Not Identified. Renal Vein Invasion: Not identified. Surgical Margins: Tumor present at renal parenchymal margin (for partial nephrectomy specimens only). See comment. Non-Neoplastic Kidney: Marked chronic inflammation and arteriolonephrosclerosis. Adrenal Gland: Not identified. Lymph Nodes: Not identified. Staging for renal cell carcinoma/oncocytoma: pT1 Tumor <= 7.0 cm in greatest dimension limited to the kidney. COMMENT: The tumors in this case exhibit a very unusual constellation of features that do not fit into any of our well defined. categories. The main tumor mass is predominantly papillary and solid with focal tubular areas. It is high grade. Focal areas of. necrosis are evident. In the adjacent renal parenchyma there are innumerable neoplastic foci that have tubular features and. basophilic cytoplasm. These measure from 3 millimeters to less than 0.1 millimeter. It is these foci of disease that are present at. the parenchymal margin of resection. The main tumor mass is immunoreactive for CK7 and focally for racemase. It is negative for. CA9. The satellite nodules are immunoreactive for CK7 but negative for racemase. BAF-47 is not interpretable. The overall. appearance is suggestive of a syndrome-associated tumor although the unusual morphology does not allow us to make this. statement with confidence or to suggest the syndrome involved, if such is the case. Close examination of the contralateral kidney. is advised. Some of the immunohistochemistry and ISH tests were developed and their performance characteristics were determined by the Department of. Pathology. They have not been cleared or approved by the US Food and Drug Administration The FDA has determined that such clearance or. approval is not necessary. These tests are used for clinical purposes. They should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This. laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. as qualified to perform high complexity clinical. laboratory testing. 2.

OC ID: SPECIMEN(S): A: Lipoma. B: Left adrenal gland and mass. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: B. Adrenal gland, left, excision: - Adrenal cortical carcinoma, low grade. - 7.8 cm greatest dimension. - 171 gm. - Margins of resection free of malignancy. - See case summary. A. Soft tissue, back, excision: - Lipoma. COMMENT: This case has been reviewed, who concurs with the. interpretation of low-grade adrenal cortical carcinoma. The findings of. a sheet-like infiltration pattern, necrosis, capsular vascular invasion,. and nuclear atypia are fairly typical of carcinomas. In addition, the. size in excess of 7 cm and the weight of 171 gm are also both more. typical of carcinoma. The eosinophilic cytoplasm is also more typical. of carcinoma. Absolute distinction between adrenal cortical adenomas. and carcinomas is not always possible; however, multiple series have. shown having many of the features described are associated with. malignant behavior. American Journal Clinical Pathology, 1996;. 105:76-86. Specimen: Adrenal gland; received: Fresh. Procedure: Adrenalectomy, total. Specimen Integrity: Intact. Specimen Size: Greatest dimensions: 17 x 8 x 4.9 cm. Specimen Laterality: Left. Tumor Size: a 7.8 x 5.7 x 4.6 cm. Tumor Gland Weight: 171 gm. Histologic Type: Adrenal cortical carcinoma. Margins: Margins uninvolved by tumor. Lymph-Vascular Invasion: Small vessel (capillary lymphatic). Pathologic Staging: pT2 pNX. Primary Tumor (pT): pT2: Tumor greater than 5 cm, no extra-adrenal. invasion. Regional Lymph Nodes (pN): pNX: Cannot be assessed. No nodes submitted or found. Distant Metastasis (pM): Not applicable. I have personally reviewed all specimens and or slides, including the. listed special stains, and used them with my medical judgement to. determine the final diagnosis. CLINICAL HISTORY: The patient is a. -year-old male with growth on adrenal gland. Operative Procedure: Lipoma excision and left adrenal gland and mass. excision. GROSS: Two formalin-filled containers are received, each labeled with the. patient's name, and medical record number. A. The first container is labeled ""A-lipoma."" The specimen. consists of four tan-red-white, and cauterized rubbery tissue measuring. ranging from 0.7 to 1.6 cm in greatest dimension and 1.8 X 1.5 x 0.8 cm. in aggregate. Sectioning reveals yellow-red solid cut surface. Entirely submitted in A1 and A2. B. The second container is received fresh and subsequently. saved in formalin and labeled ""B - left adrenal gland and mass."" The. specimen consists of a 17 X 8 X 4.9 cm and 171 gm portion of yellow. lobulated fibroadipose tissue. The entire external surface is inked. black. Sectioning reveals a 7.8 X 5.7 X 4.6 cm yellow-brown solid,. ovoid mass. Focal white firm calcifications measuring up to 0.5 cm in. greatest dimension is noted in the central area. Also, a 2.5 X 1.5 X. 1.3 cm pink and lightly fleshy area is present on the peripheral area of. the mass. A purple-red hemorrhage is noted measuring up to 2.5 cm in. greatest dimension. Grossly, the mass is entirely encapsulated. On the. edge of the mass is a 4.5 x 2.5 x 1.0 cm bright yellow-brown adrenal. gland tissue. Representative tissue was procured for potential future. studies. The specimen is photographed. Representative sections are. submitted. Summary of Sections: B1 -B3 mass with adrenal gland. B4-B5 - mass to include the pink solid area. B6 - mass to include hemorrhage. B7-mass. B8 - mass to include calcification following fixation and. decalcification. MICROSCOPIC: Microscopic examination is performed. Sections show a low-grade adrenal cortical carcinoma. The adrenal is. expanded by a 7 cm nodule of eosinophilic cells, many with nucleomegaly. and poly-lobation. Tumor is arranged largely in sheets, without. trabecular or small cell patterning. The neoplasm is thickly. encapsulated, with foci of necrosis. Focally, there is vascular. penetration of the capsule; however, the marked margins of resection are. free of malignancy. Mitotic activity is inconspicuous. Immunohistochemical stains performed on the tumor show focal. immunoreactivity to vimentin. Melan-A is focally positive, with good. internal control. There is no immunoreactivity with antibodies to. Pan-Cytokeratin (AE1/AE3). There is weak focal immunoreactivity with. antibodies to synaptophysin, but not with antibodies to chromogranin. S-100 highlights normal adipocytes. An antibody to inhibin highlights. normal adrenal cortical cells, but does not react with the tumor.

Sec. #: Visit # : Service Date: Client: Physician (s): FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS. A. Left main bile duct, biopsy: Invasive adenocarcinoma. B. Right bile duct, biopsy: Bile duct epithelium with no significant. pathologic abnormality. C. Liver, left hepatectomy with caudate en bloc resection: Cholangiocarcinoma extending to left main bile duct margin with. extensive perineural and intraneural involvement; see comment. D. Extrahepatic bile duct, resection: No high-grade dysplasia or. carcinoma identified; see comment. E. Gallbladder, cholecystectomy: 1. Chronic cholecystitis. 2. Two benign lymph nodes (0/2) . F. Right hepatic artery lymph node, biopsy: One benign lymph node. COMMENT: Liver Tumor, Including Intrahepatic Bile Duct, Synoptic Comment. - Tumor type: Cholangiocarcinoma. Histologic grade: Moderately differentiated. - Tumor size (maximum diameter of largest lesion) : 3.3 cm. - Tumor necrosis: Less than 30%. - Multifocality (more than one tumor separated by nontumorous liver. parenchyma) : Absent. - Vascular invasion: None. - Hepatic capsule: Tumor abuts capsule. Local extension of tumor: Malignant glands are present in the wall of. the left main bile duct, but not in the surrounding adipose soft tissue. - Hepatic surgical margins: Negative; tumor is 1.5 cm from margin. - Bile duct margin (for cholangiocarcinoma) : Positive on slide C1. See. additional comments below. Non-neoplastic liver: Mass effect (portal-based inflammation, scant. lobular hepatocyte necrosis, enlargement of some intrahepatic bile. ducts, and periductal fibrosis; small portal tracts show mild ductular. proliferation). - Lymph node status: - Negative for tumor; total number of nodes examined: 3. - AJCC Stage: pT1NO. In part A (left main bile duct) atypical glands are seen invading. periductal nerve tissue. Level sections and immunohistochemistry for. keratin cocktail and S100 were performed and evaluated on block A1 to. further assess the atypical glands. The keratin cocktail shows diffuse. strong nuclear staining in the atypical glands. The S100 highlights the. nerves but does not stain the atypical cells involving the nerve tissue. This supports a diagnosis of invasive adenocarcinoma. In Part C (left hepatic resection) the hepatic parenchymal resection. margin is negative. Tumor is present in the left main bile duct margin. However, surgical correlation is required for final margin status as. additional tissue is submitted in Part D and the new common bile duct. margin in the additional tissue is negative. In Part C, sections of the hepatic mass show moderately differentiated. cholangiocarcinoma invading hepatic parenchyma and nerve tissue. One. area of the adenocarcinoma is better differentiated and has dilated,. angulated ducts closely resembling a large von Meyenburg complex. Immunohistochemical stains for p53, MIB-1, DPC-4, and glypican-3. were. performed on block C3 and compared in both areas. Both areas show weak. scattered nuclear p53 staining, no loss of DPC-4, and negative. Glypican-3. The mmoderately-differentiated area shows MIB-1 staining in. 30% of tumor nuclei and focally up to 50%, while the lower grade area. shows less than 5% MIB-1 nuclear staining. The morphologic appearance. and immunoprofile are most consistent with both areas being part of the. same. lesion. It is possible that the higher-grade area of the tumor. arose from this more ell-differentiated component at some point in. time. For part D, level sections were performed and evaluated on blocks D2 and. D5 (the extrahepatic bile duct). The levels do not show any high-grade. dysplasia or carcinoma. has reviewed parts A and D including additional. immunostains and levels and agrees with the above diagnosis for these. parts. Dr. has reviewed C3 and the MIB-1 immunostain and. concurs with its interpretation. Specimen (s) Received. A:Left main bile duct (FS). B:Right bile duct. C:Extended left hepatic resection with caudate and tumor. D:Extra hepatic bile duct (FS). E:Gallbladder. F:Right hepatic artery lymph node. Intraoperative Diagnosis. FS1 (A) Left main bile duct, biopsy: Atypical glands, most consistent. with invasive carcinoma. (Dr. FS2 (B) Right bile duct, biopsy: No in situ or invasive carcinoma.

Gross Description: Received are four containers, all labeled with the patient's name. Part A is received fresh for frozen section diagnosis and additionally labeled. ""Whipple specimen, long black=uncinate, short black=pancreatic neck, blue=bile. duct.'. Specimen (components and dimensions): The specimen is the product of a Whipple. resection, previously sectioned, consisting of a 13.2 x 3.0 cm duodenum with. pancreatic head 4.7 cm in length and additional dimensions of 5.6 X 5.5 cm. Gallbladder: The gallbladder is submitted as a separate specimen (see part. B). Specimen inking pattern: Uncinate/retroperitoneal/posterior black, vascular. groove red, anterior-blue. (Please note the specimen has been previously inked. in focal areas: The bile duct inked blue, uncinate inked yellow, neck inked. black.). Tumor: Location: Pancreatic head. Size: 3.1 X 2.1 X 1.1 cm. Appearance: The tumor is white-tan to tan with ill defined borders and a. decrease in lobular architecture. The tumor is also firm. Gross impression of invasive growth: There is a biliary stent present in the. bile duct. After removal, the tumor appears to abut and obstruct the bile duct. The tumor appears to possibly abut the main pancreatic duct, however, there does. not appear to be any gross involvement and the pancreatic duct is of the usual. caliber. The tumor also appears to abut, but not grossly penetrate through the. vascular groove. Please defer to microscopic diagnosis. Resection margins (closest): Proximal duodenum or stomach: 2.1 cm. Distal duodenum: 7.4 cm. Bile duct: 2.9 cm. Pancreatic neck/duct: 2.3 cm. Uncinate/Retroperitoneum: 1.1 cm. Other findings: The attached portion of duodenum has a pink-tan to brown,. smooth and roughened serosal surface. There appears to be a 1.1 X 0.8 cm. transmural defect located 5.4 cm from the proximal end. Upon opening the. duodenum, the mucosa is pink-tan with the normal mucosal folds. The area of. transmural defect seems to the area opposing where the bile duct stent was. located. This could be a possible area of local trauma. There are two lesions. present on the duodenal mucosal surface. The first lesion is approximately 2.6. cm from the proximal duodenal margin. This lesion is concerning for possible. tumor. The lesion appears separate from the ampulla, located on the posterior. wall of the duodenum. This lesion has dimensions of 1.4 X 1.4 X 0.4 cm. The. lesion is pink-tan with raised borders with a central ulcerated area. Representative sections of the first lesion are placed in cassettes A14 and A15. The second lesion in the duodenum is approximately 4.6 cm from the proximal. surface, also located on the posterior wall of the duodenum. This lesion has. dimensions of 1.4 X 1.3 X 0.8 cm. This lesion is pink-tan with a smooth surface. The cut surface of this lesion is yellow-tan and homogeneous. Representative. sections of this lesion are placed in cassettes A16 and A17. The bile duct is removed and submitted for frozen section diagnosis (FSA1). The. tissue is resubmitted for permanent section in cassette A1. The uncinate margin. is shaved off and submitted for frozen section diagnosis (FSA2) and this tissue. is resubmitted for permanent section in cassette A2.

Bladder, prostate and seminal vesicle; B. Left pelvic lymph node; C. Left para aortic tissue; D. Right. pelvic lymph node; E. Left distal ureter; F. Right distal ureter. DIAGNOSIS: A. Bladder, prostate gland, and seminal vesicles (radical cystoprostatectomy): Bladder: Invasive high grade urothelial carcinoma. Tumor grossly and microscopically invades through the muscularis propria into perivesical fat (pT3b). Invasive carcinoma is centered primarily in the trigone and left lateral wall;. however, tumor also involves the right lateral wall, bilateral ureteral orifices,. and extends into the anterior and posterior walls. Foci of urothelial carcinoma in situ are present throughout the bladder. Extensive vascular invasion is present,. and metastatic tumor deposits are noted in perivesical soft tissue,. as well as within prostatic stroma (e.g., slides A46, A48; pMI). Perineural invasion is present. Tumor very focally abuts the inked anterior and posterior soft tissue resection margins. Distal urethral and bilateral ureteral margins are negative for carcinoma. Prostate: Multifocal prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 3+3=6. Tumors are organ-confined and present as two microscopic foci,. present in the right anterior para-apex (slide A38) and right anterior para-base (slide A50). No angiolymphatic invasion by prostatic carcinoma is identified. Seminal vesicles and all surgical margins are negative for prostatic carcinoma. TNM (bladder): pT3b N3 M1. TNM (prostate): pT2a NO Mx site: path bladder, NOS C67.9. Comment: Given the extent of lymph node dissection (see Parts B, C, and D), it is assumed that some of the nodes represent. common iliac lymph nodes, which are considered secondary sites of regional lymph node drainage and staged as pN3. Please. correlate with clinical and intraoperative findings to confirm the above pathologic ""N"" stage. B. Lymph nodes, left pelvis (excision): Metastatic urothelial carcinoma involving all fourteen lymph nodes (14/14). The largest tumor deposit measures at least 2.1 cm (microscopic).

ER: Positive - Allred Score: 8 = Proportion score: 5 + Intensity Score 3. PR: Negative - Allred Score: 0 = Proportion Score 0 + Intensity Score 0. COMMENT: The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the. proportion score (0 = no staining, 1 = <1% of cells staining, 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11-30% of. cells staining, 4 = 31-60% of cells staining, 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak. intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate intensity of staining, 3 = strong intensity of staining), with a scoring. range from 0 to 8. ER/PR positive is defined as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is defined as an Allred score of. less than or equal to 2. Methodology: Fixation Type and Length: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (. for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Antibody and Assay Metnodology: Mouse anti-human ER and PR, (. Comment: This assay can be used to select invasive breast cancer patients for hormone therapy (1). ER and PR analysis was performed on this case by immunohistochemistry utilizing the ER (ER 1D5,. 1:100) and PR (PGR 136, 1:100) antibody provided by. following the manufacturer's instructions. listed in the package insert. This assay was not modified, and adherence to all instruction and. guidelines were strictly followed. Interpretation of the ER/PR immunohistochemical staining. characteristics is guided by published results in the medical literature (1), information provided by the. reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance within the. 1. Harvey JM, et al. Estrogen receptor status by immunohistochemistry is superior to the ligand-binding. assay for predicting response to adjuvant endocrine therapy in breast cancer. Clin Oncol. 17:1474-. 1481, 1999. CLINICAL HISTORY: Patient is a. year old white female who underwent an ultrasound guided core biopsy on. which. revealed invasive ductal carcinoma of right breast with extensive pleomorphic malignant appearing. microcalcifications on mammogram. The patient opted for a right simple mastectomy and sentinel. lymph node biopsy after consideration. PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right breast cancer. ADDENDUM: SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST HER-2 RESULTS.

Intensity: 2+. % Tumor Staining: 50%. FISH Ordered YES DATE. METHODOLOGY. Methodologv: Fixation Type and Length: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (. ) for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Antibody and Assay Methodology: Rabbit anti-human HER2, HerceptestTM (FDA-approved test kit),. Control. Slides Examined: External kit-slides provided by manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative. HER2 protein expression), and in-house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along. with the test tissue. These control slides run along side of this patient's sample showed appropriate. staining. Adequacy of Specimen: Adequate, well preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma identified for. HER2 evaluation. Scoring Criterion and Scoring System: IHC Level of Expression(Score) /Tumor Cell Membrane Staining Pattern. Negative (0)/Absence of Staining. Negative (1+)/Faint Incomplete membrane Staining, >10% of Cells. Equivocal (2+)/Weak complete membrane Staining, >10% of Cells. Positive (3+)/Strong complete membrane Staining, >10% of Cells. Equivocal Category for HER2 IHC results: A HER2, 2+ staining result that is interpreted as equivocal. may not indicate gene amplification. A FISH test for HER2 gene amplification will be ordered for all. HER2 IHC 2+ results. COMMENT. This assay can be used to select invasive breast cancer patients for Trastuzumab (Hereptin) therapy. (1,2). Clinical Trials have shown that Trastuzumab substantially increases the likelihood for an objective. response and overall survival for patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, regardless of. whether HER2 tumor status was determined as IHC 3+ or FISH positive. Trastuzumab added to. adjuvant chemotherapy substantially increase disease-free survival and decreases the risk of disease. recurrence by about 50% for patients with early-stage HER2 protein over-expressed or gene amplified. invasive breast cancer (3). HER2 analysis was performed on this case by immunohistochemistry utilizing the FDA approved. (TM) test kit following the manufacturer's instructions listed in the package insert. This. assay was not modified, and adherence to all instruction and guidelines were strictly followed. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical staining characteristics is guided by published results. in the medical literature (4), information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of. staining performance within the Institute Pathology Department. HER2 TEST VALIDATION. This HER2 immunohistochemical assay has been validated according to the recently revised. recommendations and guidelines from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force, and the. jointly issued recommendations and guidelines from ASCO and the CAP (5). 80 randomly selected. breast cancer samples were tested for HER2 by IHC as outline above and interpreted as, negative. (score 0/1+) equivocal (score 2+) and positive (score 3+) without knowledge of the previous reported. results. These cases were also blindly read using two different FISH assay as amplified or non-amplified and. the HER2/CEP17 ratios were recorded. After analyzing these results, there was 100% concordance. between the IHC and FISH results for cases that were interpreted as either positive or negative by IHC. 9 of the 80 cases were interpreted as equivocal by IHC and of these 3/9 (33%) were non-amplified by. FISH and 6/9 (66%) were found to be amplified. Pathology Department Immunohistochemistry laboratory takes full responsibility for this tests. performance and has programs in place to regularly monitor the proficiency and the interpretation of. HER2 assays. The laboratory also participates in external quality assurance HER2 programs including. the CAP proficiency testing program. REFERENCE. 1.

ER: Positive - Allred Score: 8 = Proportion score: 5 + Intensity Score 3. PR: Positive - Allred Score: 7 = Proportion Score 4 + Intensity Score 3. COMMENT: The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the. proportion score (0 = no staining, 1 = <1% of cells staining, 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11-30%. of. cells staining, 4 = 31-60% of cells staining, 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak. intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate intensity of staining, 3 = strong intensity of staining), with a scoring. range from 0 to 8. ER/PR positive is defined as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is defined as an Allred score of. less than or equal to 2. Methodoloav: Fixation Type and Length: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (. ) for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Antibody and Assay Methodology: Mouse anti-human ER and PR, (Dako, Carpenteria, CA). Comment: This assay can be used to select invasive breast cancer patients for hormone therapy (1). ER and PR analysis was performed on this case by immunohistochemistry utilizing the ER (ER 1D5,. 1:100) and PR (PGR 136, 1:100) antibody provided by. following the manufacturer's instructions. listed in the package insert. This assay was not modified, and adherence to all instruction and. guidelines were strictly followed. Interpretation of the ER/PR immunohistochemical staining. characteristics is guided by published results in the medical literature (1), information provided by the. reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance within the Institute Pathology.

Methodology: Fixation Type and Length: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (Pharmco. Inc. Brookfield, CT) for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Antibody and Assay Methodology: Rabbit anti-human HER2, HerceptestTM (FDA-approved test kit), (. Control. Slides Examined: External kit-slides provided by manufacturer (cell lines with nign, low and negative. HER2 protein expression), and in-house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along. with the test tissue. These control slides run along side of this patient's sample showed appropriate. staining. Adequacy of Specimen: Adequate, well preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma identified for. HER2 evaluation. Scoring Criterion and Scoring System: IHC Level of Expression(Sco /Tumor Cell Membrane Staining Pattern. Negative (0)/Absence of Staining. Negative (1+)/Faint Incomplete membrane Staining, >10% of Cells. Equivocal (2+)/Weak complete membrane Staining, >10% of Cells. Positive (3+)/Strong complete membrane Staining, >10% of Cells. Equivocal Category for HER2 IHC results: A HER2, 2+ staining result that is interpreted as equivocal. may not indicate gene amplification. A FISH test for HER2 gene amplification will be ordered for all. HER2 IHC 2+ results. COMMENT. This assay can be used to select invasive breast cancer patients for Trastuzumab (Hereptin) therapy. (1,2). Clinical Trials have shown that Trastuzumab substantially increases the likelihood for an objective. response and overall survival for patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, regardless of. whether HER2 tumor status was determined as IHC 3+ or FISH positive. Trastuzumab added to. adjuvant chemotherapy substantially increase disease-free survival and decreases the risk of disease. recurrence by about 50% for patients with early-stage HER2 protein over-expressed or gene amplified. invasive breast cancer (3). HER2 analysis was performed on this case by immunohistochemistry utilizing the FDA approved. (TM) test kit following the manufacturer's instructions listed in the package insert. This. assay was not modified, and adherence to all instruction and guidelines were strictly followed. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical staining characteristics is guided by published results. in the medical literature (4), information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of. staining performance within the Pathology Department. HER2 TEST VALIDATION. This HER2 immunohistochemical assay has been validated according to the recently revised. recommendations and guidelines from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force, and the. jointly issued recommendations and guidelines from ASCO and the CAP (5). 80 randomly selected. breast cancer samples were tested for HER2 by IHC as outline above and interpreted as, negative. (score 0/1+) equivocal (score 2+) and positive (score 3+) without knowledge of the previous reported. results. These cases were also blindly read using two different FISH assay as amplified or non-amplified and. the HER2/CEP17 ratios were recorded. After analyzing these results, there was 100% concordance. between the IHC and FISH results for cases that were interpreted as either positive or negative by IHC. 9 of the 80 cases were interpreted as equivocal by IHC and of these 3/9 (33%) were non-amplified by. FISH and 6/9 (66%) were found to be amplified. Institute Pathology Department Immunohistochemistry laboratory takes full responsibility for this tests. performance and has programs in place to regularly monitor the proficiency and the interpretation of. HER2 assays. The laboratory also participates in external quality assurance HER2 programs including. the CAP proficiency testing program. REFERENCE. 1.

Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the Pathology. Core Facility by Dr.. A majority of tumors cells displayed moderate polysomy 17. with 2 to 4 chromosome 17 signals and 2 to 4 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0,. consistent with no amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used F1. Source of case: RPCI. Tissue fixation. formalin-fixed tissue. Outside Case No: NA. Tissue source. breast Results interpreted: HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.46. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-. 2/neu. gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test. FDA APPROVED REAGENT. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of. patients for whom Herceptin therapv is being considered. These tests were performed in the. under the direction. of Dr..

Gender: F. Date of Service: A copy of this report will be faxed to: FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT. Diagnosis: LEFT BREAST, MODIFIED RADICAL MASTECTOMY: - Two foci of invasive ductal carcinoma, Nottingham grade 2 (see comment). - Size: 2.3 cm and 0.7 cm. - Location: lower outer (4:00) and inner (7:00) quadrants, respectively. Associated ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), intermediate nuclear. grade, cribriform and micropapillary patterns with punctate necrosis. and without calcifications. - Size: DCIS spans a region measuring approximately 3.8 cm and. comprises 10% of tumor. - Margins of resection are widely free of invasive and in situ tumor (at least 1.2 cm. away). - Focus suspicious for lymphovascular invasion identified. Micrometastatic carcinoma (1.7 mm) identified in one of fourteen axillary. lymph nodes (1/14); no extranodal extension identified. - Prior biopsy site changes present. - Uninvolved breast parenchyma with fibrocystic changes and vascular. calcifications. - Benign skin and nipple. COMMENT: The two foci of invasive ductal carcinoma are similar histologically. Although there was little tubule formation identified on prior needle biopsy of the 7:00. lesion, tubule formation is more apparent on excision (>10%). Thus, the overall. histologic grade is Nottingham grade 2 for both lesions. PATHOLOGIC TUMOR STAGING SYNOPSIS: Type and grade (invasive): Invasive ductal carcinoma, Nottingham grade 2.

Part C is labeled ""bladder and prostate,"" and consists of a cystoprostatectomy specimen (664 gm; 11.3. cm from right to left x 6.8 cm from anterior to posterior x 23 cm from superior to inferior). GROSS PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS: There is a soft, tan-pink, friable, papillary lesion (1.6 cm from right to. left x 4.2 cm from superior to inferior x 1.7 cm deep) apparently extending into the perivesicular fat. The lesion is centered above the left trigone area, abutting the left ureteral orifice, and extends. superiorly up the left lateral wall to 1.1 cm below the dome of the bladder. The muscular invasion. appears to extend from the left lateral to the right lateral wall just past the midline, and in the right. lateral wall involving a portion of the muscle that is 3.5 x 1 x 0.8 cm, and not extending into the fat of. the right lateral bladder wall. The main lesion is 1 cm from the urethral orifice, 0.8 cm from the left. ureteral orifice, 3.1 cm from the right ureteral orifice, and 0.9 cm at the closest approach to the. perivesicular fat margin (left, blue); 0.5 cm from the right external perivesicular margin the right lateral. wall portion of the lesion. The lesion does not involve the ureteral orifice. The surrounding bladder. mucosa is pink, smooth, boggy, and edematous with punctate hemorrhages in the trigone area. The. attached prostate is pink-tan and lobular with nodules ranging from 0.5-0.8 cm in greatest dimension,. mostly in the anterior portion of the gland. The ureters are not attached. The attached perivesicular and periprostatic fat is carefully searched for. lymph nodes. ORIENTED BY: Anatomic landmarks.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: APC DIAGNOSIS: ""Adenocarcinoma (tissue submitted for genomics study)' by Dr. GROSS DESCRIPTION. A. Received in formalir is a wedge of lung, measuring -8.0 X 4.0 X 3.0 cm. There is a staple line, measuring 8.5 cm. The pleural surface is focally. hemorrhagic, congested, and moderately anthracotic. In addition, the pleura. is retracted adjacent to the staple line, measuring 2.5 cm in greatest. dimensions. The pleural surface is inked black and the staple line margin is. inked blue. On sectioning, a poorly circumscribed tan-gray tumor mass,. measuring 3.5 X 3.0 X 1.5 cm is identified. The tumor mass grossly abuts the. pleural surface and comes to within 0.1 cm of the staple line margin. The cut. surface of the mass is hemorrhagic, gritty, and focally friable. The. uninvolved portion of lung is tan-pink and spongy. Representative sections. are submitted in four cassettes as follows: cassette 1 - tumor mass, pleural. surface, and staple line margin; cassette 2 - tumor mass and pleural surface;. cassette 3 - tumor mass and staple line margin; cassette 4 - uninvolved lung. APC. Received in formalin is an irregular portion of tan-gray soft tissue,. measuring 2.2 X 1.0 X 0.2 cm. Its cut surface shows a poorly circumscribed. tan-gray area, measuring 1.2 X 1.0 X 0.2 cm. The specimen is entirely. submitted in one cassette. B. Received in formalir are multiple irregular pieces of tan-pink. fibroconnective tissue with adjoining lymph nodes, measuring 2.5 X 2.0 X 0.5. cm in aggregate. Upon palpation, two tan-gray nodules, measuring 0.2 cm and. Not for Permanent Storage in Medical Records / Not Valid for Signing. Date of Service. Performing Facility. Result Provider. Report Name. Surgical Report. 0.8 cm in greatest dimension, are found. The nodules are entirely submitted. in one cassette. C. Received in formalin is a 230 gram lobe of lung, measuring 18.0 X 14.0 X. 4.5 cm in overall dimensions. There are multiple staple lines adjacent to the. hilum, ranging from 3.0 cm to 10.0 cm in greatest dimension. The pleural. surface is tan-pink, moderately anthracotic and diffusely hemorrhagic and. congested adjacent to the hilum. There is a portion of bronchus at the hilum,. measuring 0.6 cm in length X 2.5 cm in diameter. Also there is a portion of. vessel, measuring 0.4 cm in length X 1.0 cm in diameter. The vascular,. bronchial, and staple line margins are inked blue and the pleural surface is. inked black. On sectioning, a circumscribed tan-gray tumor mass, measuring. 0.8 X 0.6 X 0.5 cm is identified. The mass comes to within 2.5 cm from the. pleural surface, 6.0 cm from the bronchial resection margin, and 5.5 cm from. the closest staple line margin. The cut surface is gray and mucoid. In. addition, directly adjacent to the hilum, approximately 1.0 cm from the. bronchial margin, and 0.1 cm from the closest staple line margin is a very. poorly circumscribed tan-orange lesion, measuring 2.0 X 1.5 X 1.0 cm. The. lesion comes to within 1.0 cm from the pleural surface. The remainder of the. lung parenchyma is spongy and congested and shows a bulla located at the upper. pole, measuring 2.0 X 2.0 X 1.0 cm. A single anthracotic lymph node,. measuring 0.5 cm in greatest dimension, is identified at the hilum. Representative sections are submitted in eight cassettes as follows: cassette. 1 - bronchial margin; cassette 2 - vascular margin and lymph node at the. hilum; cassette 3 - small tumor; cassette 4 - pleural surface closest to the. tumor; cassette 5 - orange lesion adjacent to hilum; cassette 6 - orange. lesion and closest staple line margin; cassette 7 - bulla: cassette 8 - lung. parenchyma. D. Received in formalin is an irregular portion of tan-pink soft tissue,. measuring 1.5 X 0.7 X 0.4 cm. The specimen contains multiple staples. The. staples are removed and no discrete lymph node is found. The specimen is. entirely submitted in one cassette. E. Received in formalin is a dark brown to black ovoid nodule, measuring 1.2. X 0.5 X 0.3 cm. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal an anthracotic. cut surface. The specimen is entirely submitted in one cassette. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: A & APC. Five slides are examined. Sections of lung include a tumor mass. composed of complex anastomosing glands and papillae within fibrous stroma. The tumor cells have abundant eosinophilic to clear cytoplasm with polygonal. cytoplasmic borders. The nuclei are enlarged and ovoid to irregular, with. thickened nuclear membranes, coarsely granular chromatin and prominent. nucleoli. Scattered mitoses are present. Tumor focally extends into the. visceral pleura, forming a fibrotic nodule on the pleural surface, composed of. Not for Permanent-Storage in Medical Records Not Valid for Signing. Date of Service. Performing Faciliti. Result Provider. Report Name. Surgical Report. more solid nests of cells within fibrotic stroma. B. One slide is examined. These are sections of lymph node characterized by. moderate sinus histiocytosis and anthracosis. There is no evidence of. involvement by tumor. C. Eight slides are examined. Sections of lung include residual tumor. (slides 5 and 6 ), composed of abnormal glands. There is surrounding. pneumonitis with aggregated foamy histiocytes present within alveoli,. associated with interstitial infiltration by inflammatory cells, including. lymphocytes, plasma cells and eosinophils. Sections of the second-described. mass (block C3) reveal a circumscribed, but non-encapsulated, nodular mass,. composed of a monotonous population of cells having ovoid to spindle-shaped. nuclei, arranged in a nested/organoid pattern. The cells have bland chromatin. with inconspicuous nucleoli. Mitotic figures are not readily identified. The. grossly-described bullous area is characterized by irregular disruption of the. subpleural alveolar architecture, associated with irregular fibrous thickening. of the pleura, which is infiltrated by chronic inflammatory cells, including. lymphocytes and plasma cells, forming occasional loose aggregates. Clusters. of pigmented histiocytes are present within the dilated alveolar spaces. Random sections of lung reveal mild patchy dilation of alveoli, most notably. within the peripheral portions of the parenchyma. No other tumor is. identified. Sections of the bronchial margin are lined by ciliated,. pseudostratified columnar epithelium with areas of squamous metaplasia. The. vascular margin of resection is uninvolved by tumor. A peribronchial lymph. node is characterized by sinus histiocytosis and anthracosis. There is no. morphologic evidence of involvement by tumor. D. One slide is examined, including the entirely submitted specimen. These. are sections of a biopsy portion of lung, composed of benign alveolar. parenchyma. There is adherent fibrofatty tissue, consistent with parietal. pleura. There is no evidence of involvement by tumor. No lymph node is. identified. E. One slide is examined. These are sections of clotted blood and organizing. fibrin. A few clusters of mildly reactive mesothelial cells are focally. present within the clot, occasionally forming gland-like structures. No lymph. node is identified within the entirely submitted specimen. SPECIAL STAINS: A. section of tumor (block A1) is stained by the immunoperoxidase method for. thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1). The tumor cells reveal weak to. moderate intranuclear positivity, consistent with lung primary. A section of. block E is also stained for TTF -1. The clusters of cells morphologically. interpreted as mesothelial cells, are negative by this stain. Also stained is. a section of the spindle cell tumor, seen on block C3, within the completion. lobectomy specimen. The cells comprising the lesion are strongly and.

ASSAY PERFORMED: HER2 GENE AMPLIFICATION BY DUAL IN SITU HYBRIDIZATION USING THE. HER2 Dual ISH DNA PROBE COCKTAIL. Number of nuclei scored: 20. Total HER2 signals: 60. Total CHR 17 signals: 39. HER2/CHR 17 ratio: 1.5. INTERPRETATION: - NEGATIVE FOR HER2 GENE AMPLIFICATION. NOTE: THE ASSAY WAS PERFORMED AS A REFLEX TEST AFTER THE HER2/NEU IMMUNOSTAIN WAS 2+. SPECIMEN TYPE: The. HER2. is performed on a formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue slide from. block C3. DESCRIPTION OF THE ASSAY: The. HER2. assay. enables the HER2. gene and Chr17 centromere to be co-hybridized and visualized via light microscopy on the same slide. Specifically for this assay,. HER2 is detected by a dinitrophenyl (DNP) labeled probe visualized utilizing. SISH DNP (silver in situ hybridization). detection kit. The Chr17 centromere is targeted with a digoxigenin (DIG) labeled probe and detected using. ISHDIG. detection kit. Dual ISH staining results in visualization by light microscopy and which HER2 appears as discrete black signals (SISH). and Chr17 as red signals in nuclei of normal cells serving as internal positive control for staining) as well as in carcinoma cells. SLIDE SCORING: Once an adequate target area is identified the reader records the scores for HER2 and Chr17 copy numbers that. are present in 20 representative nuclei. If the resulting HER2 / Chr17 ratio falls within 1.8-2.2 (EQUIVOCAL) the reader is. recommended to score an additional 20 nuclei and the resulting ratio is calculated from the total 40 nuclei.

Cample ID #. Diagnosis: 1.: Tumor-free lipomatous atrophic lymph node. 2.: Right hemicolectomy specimen with tumor-free resection margins and under inclusion. of an ulcerated, malignant, solid tumor in the cecum, conforming to the type of a poorly. differentiated adenocarcinoma, with infiltration of the lamina muscularis propria and. without regional lymph node metastases (G3, pT2 L0 V0 R0 pN0 0/27). Additional immunohistological investigations are being conducted due to the histological. peculiarities of the tumor. A follow-up report on this will be submitted at a later date. Follow-up report: From an immunohistological perspective, the tumor cells were positive for broad-. spectrum cytokeratins. Large numbers of CD3-positive and CD20-negative or T-. lymphocytes are also interspersed. Based on the histology and immunohistology, this is thus a poorly differentiated. colorectal adenocarcinoma, or cecum carcinoma, with a dense lymphocytic stromal. infiltrate. The poor tumor differentiation and the dense lymphocytic inflammatory infiltration may. be indicators of the presence of a microsatellite unstable (possibly HNPCC-associated). colorectal carcinoma.

The larynx is opened posteriorly on the midline at the. time of frozen section analysis. There are three tracheal rings attached. There is a tan-white appearing mass measuring 2.5 X 1.9 cm in surface area and 2.2 cm in thickness involving the. glottic larynx. The mass is grossly located on the bilateral false cord, vestibule true cord and crosses the midline. The mass does not appear to involve pyriform sinus. Grossly, the mass extends 2.4 cm from the tip of the epiglottic. mucosal edge, 2.3 cm from the base of the tongue mucosal edge, 2.4 cm from the lateral right mucosal edge, 1.1 cm. from the lateral left mucosal edge and 3.1 cm from the distal tracheal edge. None of the tracheal rings grossly. appear involved the mass. On the anterior aspect of the specimen is an ellipse of abnormal skin measuring 4.5 x 4.3. x 1.0 cm. The inferior aspect of the skin ellipse measures 2.3 cm from the distal tracheal edge.

Comment: A few scattered large cells with low nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio, enlarged nuclei with nucleoli, and bubbly cytoplasm are. present, and are suspicious for renal cell carcinoma, clear cell type. Despite the atypical features, these cells, in this. context, cannot be definitively categorized as neoplastic without appropriate immunohistochemical confirmation. The. very scant nature of the specimen precludes additional confirmatory diagnostic studies.

Material examined: Left upper lobe, among others. Clinical diagnosis and question. Space-occupying lesion of unclear pathogenesis left upper lobe, with pleural contact. REPORT ON FINDINGS. Macroscopy. 1.) Inflated, fixed upper lobe of left lung measuring 24 x 14 x 7 cm, central bronchus resection plane located 0.8. cm proximal to the birfurcation of the lingular bronchus. A 4.5 cm long staple suture line runs in a dorsocaudal. direction from the hilus. At the hilus are four lesioned grayish-black nodes between 0.8 and 1.4 cm. Lateral. pleural over segment 2 shows an unclearly demarcated 3 cm area of whitish discoloration characterized by a. depression-like retraction, under which is a moderately solid, predominantly pale brownish and partly patchy. grayish-black tumor, max. 5.5 cm in size, with a relatively clear and somewhat arcuate demarcation, extending. to the pleura in the region of the retraction. Truncation or opening of peripheral branches of B2, B1 and B3 in. the tumor. Lateral pleural region at the junction of S3/S4 shows an unclearly demarcated 0,4 cm area of. induration. Rest of parenchyma shows rarefaction in apical region of segment 1 with lacunae or lacuna systems. up to 0.6 cm in size, otherwise inconspicuous. 2.) Parietal pleura: membranous tissue measuring 10,5 x 8.5 cm and up to 0.1 cm thick with partly smooth,. partly rough surface,. 3) Interlobar LN (item 11) left: three lesioned grayish-black nodes or node parts, 0.3 and 1.1 cm in size. 4) Hilar LN (item 10) left: two lesioned grayish-black nodes or node parts, 0.4 and 1.3 cm in size, partly with. some surrounding tissue. 5) Subcarinal LN (item 7): 1 cm lesioned grayish-black node or node part. 6) Paraaortic LN (item 6) left: combined 1.5 cm quantity of party grayish-red, partly blackish specimens. between 0.1 and 0.8 cm. 7) Subaortic LN (aortopulmonary window) (item 5) left: 2 cm lesioned grayish-black nodes with some. surrounding tissue. 8.) Low paratracheal LN (item 4) left: 2.2 cm lesioned grayish-brown node with some surrounding tissue. Examined: 1.) 2 sections of tumor with remaining parenchyma, 3 sections with pleura, indurated area (halved), 2 sections. of apical S1, central bronchus resection plane, resection margins of vessels, hilar nodes,. 2.) All material (lamellated),. 3.) - 8.) All material (in 7. + 8. preparations lamellated),. 15 blocks, partly Elastica-van Gieson, PAS, diastase-PAS. Microscopy. Description of histological and cytological findings omitted for capacity reasons. EVALUATION. Primary diagnosis/diagnoses: Intermediate to peripheral manifest bronchopulmonary, histologically poorly differentiated, partly. gigantocellular and polymorphocellular squamous cell carcinoma of the upper lobe of the left lung. TNM. classification according to this picture pT2 pNO V1 R0, stage IB. C 34.1; M 8070/3. Secondary diagnosis/diagnoses: Small tumor necroses and tumor-related inflammation. Active, partly resorptive inflammation of the lung. parenchyma surrounding the tumor with inclusion of numerous macrophages. Circumscribed subpleural. alveolar and interstitial organizing and remodeling zone of the lung parenchyma with inclusion of immature or. atypical squamous cell metaplasia also involving the bronchioles (S3 /4). Apical emphysematous stromal. remodeling with formation of small subpleural cysts. Slight anthracotic pigment deposits in the lung. parenchyma and moderately marked deposits in the lymph nodes. Chronic parietal pleuritis with fibrosis. of. varying degrees (sample 2.)). Remark/addendum: This is probably a primarily peripheral carcinoma of the lung which, after central growth, has infiltrated. intermediate or subsegmental bronchi of segments 1 - 3 there, because there is tumor invasion of the overlying. visceral pleura, where there is also marked fibrosis. The main tumor mass is located in segment 2. The fibrosing. lesion of the lung parenchyma in the boundary region of segments S3/4, which includes atypical squamous cell. nests, could be the initial stage of a second bronchopulmonary carcinoma focus, because the histological picture. is not typical of a satellite nodule. But ultimately, the differential diagnosis of an atypical squamous cell. metaplasia in the context of a circumscribed fibrosing process initiated by inflammation cannot be made with. a. sufficient degree of reliability.

Date Complete: Addendum Diagnosis. Sections of the previously decalcified ribs and soft tissues (specimen E). demonstrate a focus of invasive carcinoma involving the posterior rib margin. (block E4). Date Complete: Results-Comments. At the request of Dr. a representative portion of this case was. sent to Molecular Pathology for KRAS mutation analysis. This addendum is. created to report those findings. Cerner accession number: Body site: Left lung, left upper lobe. Specimen type: Paraffin embedded tissue. Surgical Pathology Block number: No KRAS mutations were detected (Wild Type KRAS) at codon 12 of the. KRAS gene in the provided specimen. The codon 13 mutations could not be. analyzed. INTERPRETATION: No KRAS mutations were identified at codon 12 of the KRAS gene. in the provided specimen. The codon 13 mutations could not be analyzed. METHODIASSAY LIMITATIONS: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist before. processing. DNA is isolated and the exon 2 of the KRAS gene is amplified by PCR. PCR products are subjected to Shifted Termination Assay (STA-TrimGen) technology. to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13. STA products are analyzed by capillary. gel electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. This assay is validated for the. detection of mutations in codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene. Mutations in other. codons of KRAS are not evaluated. False positive or negative results may occur. for reasons that include genetic variants or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue. sample analyzed. Mutations present in a low percentage of cells may not be. detected. Results should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical and other. laboratory information findings for the most accurate interpretation.

GROSS DESCRIPTION. A. Received fresh, subsequently fixed in formalin labeled. ""left upper lobe"" is a 196 gram, 16 X 11 X 4.5 cm. lobe of. lung which is partially covered with a gray violaceous smooth. glistening pleura which shows diffuse black stippling. The hilum. is. heavily stapled. There is a 1.5 cm. umbilication which is located. opposite of the hilum. This area is inked blue and the specimen is. sectioned in this area to show a 3.2 X 3.2 X 2.3 cm. ell-circumscribed white-tan indurated lesion. This comes within 4.5. cm. of the hilar margin. This is contiguous with the umbilication. The remainder of the parenchyma is red-pink and spongy showing no. other discrete gross lesions identified. Possible hilar node is. grossly identified. Representative sections of the specimen are. submitted as follows: BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 - bronchial and vascular margins; 2 - possible. hilar node; 3 - representative normal; 4-8 - representative section. of tumor which inclu. o. o normal parenchyma and tumor to. umbilication. RS-8. B. Received fresh, subsequently fixed in formalin labeled. ""level 10 lymph node"" is a 1.5 X 1.0 X 0.4 cm aggregate of. pink-red irregular soft tissue fragments which are grossly. consistent with possible lymphoid tissue.

The tumor mass blends into the adjacent thick fibrotic tissue. The. tumor comes to within 1.0 cm of the medial margin. 0.2 cm of the lateral. margin. 2.0 cm of the superior margin, 0.7 cm of the inferior margin. 1.5 cm. of the skin and nipple, and abuts the posterior margin. The reinaining cut. surface is composed of approximately 50% adipose tissue and 50% fibrous. tissue. A biopsy cavity or metallic clip is not found. Representative. sections are sequentially submitted, from medial to lateral. in six cassettes. as follows: cassette 1 - medial margin; cassette 2 - nipple with anterior. aspect: cassette 3 - tumor mass with closest posterior margin; cassette 4 -. tumor mass with superior margin; cassette 5 - tumor mass with inferior margin;. cassette 6 - tumor mass with lateral margin. C. Received in formalin is an irregular portion of tan-yellow fatty tissue. measuring 5 X 4 x 2 cm. Six possible lymph nodes. ranging from 0.4 X 0.3 x. 0.3 cm to 1.5 x 1.0 X 0.8 cm, are identified. The cut surface of the largest. lymph node shows foci of tan-gray discoloration. The lymph nodes are entirely. submitted in four cassettes as follows cassette 1 - one intact and one. bisected lymph node; cassette 2 - one lymph node: cassette 3 - two bisected. lymph nodes (one inked black): cassette 4 - largest lymph node. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: A & APC. One slide is examined for each portion of the case. Both slides. demonstrate extensive lymph node involvement by poorly differentiated. carcinoma. Because of the obvious nature of this finding, it will not be. necessary to perform a cytokeratin stain. B/BPC. Six slides are examined. Slide 1 show benign breast tissue without. evidence of tumor involvement. The red inked medial margin is free of. tumor. Slide 2 shows tissue from the region of the nipple. There is patchy. ductal hyperplasia and no evidence of Paget's disease is evident. Slide 3. shows extensive infiltrating carcinoma with a pattern most suggestive of. lobular carcinoma with periductal targetoid-lik areas and numerous foci of. ""Indian file"" arrangement. On this slide, tumor is present approximately 0.1. mm to the black inked posterior surface. The tumor shows no evidence of. tubular formation (tubules = 3). Nuclei exhibit occasional prominent nucleoli. and these seem to be multiple in some scattered foci. In the most mitotically. active areas of tumor, approximately eighteen to nineteen mitoses are present. within ten high power field (mitoses = 2). The Nottingham score of this. lesion is therefore 7 (3+3+2). making this a grade II lesion. Slide 4 shows. no evidence of malignancy. Slide 5 shows infiltrating carcinoma with a clear. inferior green inked margin. Changes consistent with a prior biopsy site dre. also present. No tumor is seen on slide 6. C.

ADDENDUM 3: EGFR Mutation Analysis. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: Positive for the E746 A750del5 mutation in Exon 19. INTERPRETATION: Deletion mutations in exon 19, mostly involving the. LREA motif, are reported to correlate with responsiveness to EGFR. tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies in patients with non-small-cell. lung carcinoma. COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more cellularity is optimal for. this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 70% tumor. cellularity upon pathologist review. E746 A750del5 corresponds to 2235 2249dell5. Mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth. factor receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with. differential responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase. inhibitor (TKI) therapies. The objective response rate among. patients with a sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%. This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;. based on the current literature, most mutations in non-small-cell. lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons. Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be. detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change. during tumor progression of the course of therapy; therefore, this. result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation. in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor. This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The. clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types. is unknown. METHOD: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the samples, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by. bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. DISCLAIMER: This test was developed and its performance characteristics. determined by. It has not been cleared or approved by the. US Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such. clearance or approval is not necessary. This test is used for. clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as investigation or. for research. The laboratory is regulated under the Clinical. Laboratory Improvement Amendments of. as qualified to. perform high complexity clinical testing. This particular test is. not considered a stand alone test and should be used only in the. context of other diagnostic tests or clinical work-up related to. treatment decisions. Addendum #3 performed by. The electronic signature attests that the named Attending. Pathologist has evaluated the specimen referred to in the signed. section of the report and formulated the diagnosis therein. This report may include one or more immunohistochemical stain. results that use analyte specific reagents. The tests were developed and their performance characteristics. determined by.

ADDENDUM #1 FOR MOLECULAR TESTS: KRAS, EGFR and ALK were sent on. or patient. The test is to be performed on tissue from case. The case report, slides, and blocks for the cited. accession number were retrieved from archives. The pathologist whose. signature appears below reviewed the original pathology report,. examined candidate H&E slides, and selected block 4E appropriate to. the specifications of the ordered molecular analysis. x1 H&E and x9. unstained slides were prepared and forwarded to. where the. subject molecular test will be performed. An addendum report will be. issued when the results of this molecular test are available. Addendum #1 performed by. ADDENDUM 2: MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY. KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS. Specimen #: RESULTS: Wild type gene. INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13 of. the KRAS gene. COMMENT: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor. prognosis, and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor. therapies in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS. mutations occur in 15-30% of NSCLC patients and are strongly. associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history. This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;. based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are. expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of. the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low. percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated. for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in. fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In. particular the test performance has been established in samples of. colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma which harbor. these mutations, although several other tissues are also known to. harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary,. appendix, etc.). Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide. additional information regarding this patient's probability of. response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if. clinically indicated. See references. METHOD/LIMITATION: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single. nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;. primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. REFERENCES: This test was developed and its performance characteristics. determined by. It has not been cleared or approved by the. US Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such. clearance or approval is not necessary. This test is used for. clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as investigational or. for research. The laboratory is regulated under the Clinical. Laboratory Improvement Amendments of. as qualified to. perform high complexity clinical testing.

RENAL PATHOLOGY EVALUATION OF THE KIDNEY PARENCHYMA: LEFT KIDNEY, NEPHRECTOMY. IMMUNE COMPLEX MEDIATED GLOMERULONEPHRITIS, PREDOMINANTLY WITH. SUBEPITHELIAL AND INTRAMEMBRANOUS DEPOSITS, MOST SUGGESTIVE OF. A MEMBRANOUS PATTERN OF GLOMERULAR INJURY (SEE NOTE). MODERATE CHRONIC CHANGES OF THE KIDNEY PARENCHYMA: - FOCAL GLOBAL GLOMERULOSCLEROSIS (18 of OF GLOMERULI) ;. - MILD TUBULAR ATROPHY AND INTERSTITIAL FIBROSIS (108 OF THE. PARENCHYMA) ;. ARTERIAL AND ARTERIOLAR SCLEROSIS, MODERATE (SEE NOTE). NOTE: The immunofluorescence and electron microscopic evaluation of the tissue. suggests an immune complex mediated glomerulonephritis. Electron microscopic. evaluation shows that the majority of the deposits are subepithelial and. intramembranous in location. This pattern of injury suggests a membranous. nephropathy, currently probably not very active. A systemic autoimmune disease. (SLE) or a remote post -infectious - glomerulonephritis cannot be ruled out with. absolute certainty. Kidney Pathologist, performed the evaluation and. interpretation of this material. DESCRIPTION: Sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue (block A11) were evaluated. using HE, PAS, Jones silver methenamine, and AFOG (trichrome) stains; an. HE-stained frozen section and semithin submitted for light microscopy. The sample consists of renal cortex and medulla. There are up to 173 glomeruli. present in the sample. Thirty- two (32) glomeruli are globally obsolescent. (sclerosed) The preserved glomeruli show a mild increase in mesangial matrix. as seen on the PAS stain. The peripheral capillary walls reveal thick basement. membranes, with fine ""spike""-like projections and many ""craters"". These changes. are best visible on the Jones' silver methenamine stain. Tubules show normal. cellular details. There are isolated, PAS-positive casts present in some. distal tubules. Focal tubular atrophy is seen in areas of interstitial. fibrosis. Significant interstitial inflammation is not evident in the sample. examined. Approximately 10 % of the tissue included in this biopsy shows. tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis, as evidenced on the trichrome stains. (AFOG) Arteries show moderate sclerosis of the media, with focal replacement. of smooth muscle cells by connective tissue. Arterioles reveal moderate. subintimal hyaline accumulation toluidine blue-stained sections were also. evaluated by light microscopy. IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPY REPORT. Sections of frozen tissue were incubated with antibodies specific for the heavy. chains of IgG, IgA, and IgM, kappa and lambda light chains, C3, Clq, albumin,. and fibrin-related antigens. The sample consists of kidney cortex and. medulla. There are four (4). glomeruli present, of which three (3) are globally sclerosed. There is diffuse. granular deposition of IgM (trace), IgG (+/4+) and fibrinogen (+/4+) in the. mesangial areas and along the peripheral capillary walls. There is also diffuse. linear deposition of albumin (+/4+) along all basement membranes. Tubules. contain reabsorbed proteins (albumin, IgG, C3) in the form of cytoplasmic. granules. Tubular basement membranes reveal focal deposition of C3 (trace). Few casts in distal tubules are reactive for polyclonal IgA. The interstitium. reveals scattered fibrin deposits. There is no difference noted in the. intensity of the staining for kappa and lambda light chains in the casts, in. the deposits, or in the background of the tissue. ELECTRON MICROSCOPY REPORT. Blocks: 4; Blocks examined: 4 thick sections; 1 thin section. The tissue examined at the ultrastructural level includes five (5) glomeruli. The glomerular capillary walls are greatly distorted by the presence of. numerous subepithelial and intramembranous electron dense deposits and. thickening of the basement membranes. Individual deposits are often surrounded. by basement membrane material and ""spikes"". The electron dense deposits are. finely granular but they do not show organized substructures There is. extensive effacement of visceral epithelial cell foot processes present and. widespread microvillous degeneration of the epithelial cell membrane. Several. epithelial cells also show prominent vacuoles and increased numbers of. lysosomes. Glomerular endothelial cells appear unremarkable and do not contain. tubuloreticular structures. Subendothelial electron dense deposits are not. seen. The mesangium shows normal cell elements and an extracellular matrix with. few irregular electron dense deposits. Report Status : Final. Type: Cytogenetics. Cytogeneticist. KARYOTYPE: T1: 45,XY,-8[10] T2: 45,XY,-8[10]. METAPHASES COUNTED: 20. ANALYZED: 10. SCORED: 10. BANDING GTG. INTERPRETATION: Two different specimens were received from this tumor. Loss of one chromosome. 8, as the sole chromosome abnormality, was seen in both specimens This. aberration is not known to be characteristic of any particular type of tumor. COMMENTS: Mosaicism and small chromosome anomalies may not be detectable using the. standard methods employed. Chromosome analysis was performed at a level of 400. bands or greater. INDICATION FOR TEST: ? RCC.
