1. The patient has a diagnosis of papillary renal cell carcinoma, which is a type of kidney cancer.
2. The tumor measures 3.0 cm, which is a relatively small size.
3. The tumor is classified as Fuhrman grade 2, which indicates a moderate level of aggressiveness.
4. The tumor has invaded into the perinephric fat, which is a sign of local invasion.
5. The tumor is staged as pT3aNxMx, Stage III, which indicates that the tumor has extended beyond the kidney and into the surrounding tissue, but there is no evidence of distant metastases.
6. The resection margins are negative, which means that the tumor was completely removed during surgery.
7. There is no lymph node involvement identified, which suggests that the cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes.
