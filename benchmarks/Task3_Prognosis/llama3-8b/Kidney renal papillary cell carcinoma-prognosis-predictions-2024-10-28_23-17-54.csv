0,"Here are the reasoning steps:

1. The patient has a diagnosis of papillary renal cell carcinoma, which is a type of kidney cancer.
2. The tumor is 3.0 cm in size, which is relatively small.
3. The tumor is classified as Fuhrman grade 2, which is a moderate-grade tumor.
4. The tumor has invaded into the perinephric fat, which indicates that it has spread beyond the kidney.
