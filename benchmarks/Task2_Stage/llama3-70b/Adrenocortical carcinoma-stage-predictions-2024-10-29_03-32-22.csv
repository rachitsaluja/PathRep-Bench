From the pathology report, we can identify the following key features:

1. Tumor size: 14.5 x 11 x 7.9 cm, which is a large tumor.
2. Capsular invasion: Present, indicating that the tumor has invaded the adrenal gland capsule.
3. Vascular invasion: Present, indicating that the tumor has invaded blood vessels.
4. Surgical margins: Initially reported as positive (superior), but later revised to negative after discussion with the surgeon.
5. Necrosis: Present (20%), indicating that 20% of the tumor tissue is necrotic.
6. Mitotic rate: 51/50 high power field, indicating a high mitotic rate.
7. Grade: High-grade, indicating a poorly differentiated tumor.
8. Lymph nodes status: 0/1, indicating that one lymph node was examined and found to be negative for carcinoma.
9. Extra-adrenal extension: Present, indicating that the tumor has extended beyond the adrenal gland.

Based on these features, we can determine the T stage as T4 (tumor has extended beyond the adrenal gland) and the N stage as NX (lymph nodes cannot be assessed). There is no evidence of distant metastasis (M0).

According to the AJCC staging system, a T4NXM0 tumor corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
1,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions ""pT3"", which indicates the primary tumor (T) is at least 10 cm in size, which is a T3 classification according to the AJCC staging system.

2. The report also mentions ""pN1"", which indicates that there are positive lymph nodes (N1). This suggests that the cancer has spread to regional lymph nodes.

3. The report further mentions ""pM1 (LYM) L1"", which indicates that there are distant metastases (M1) in the lymph nodes (LYM) and liver (L1). This suggests that the cancer has spread to distant organs.

4. Based on the TNM classification, the presence of distant metastases (M1) automatically places the cancer at Stage IV, regardless of the T and N classifications.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IV}"
2,"## Answer

From the pathology report, we can identify the following key features:

1. The tumor is an adrenocortical carcinoma, low-grade, with a size of 8.5 x 5.2 x 4.8 cm and a weight of 160 grams.
2. The tumor has extra-adrenal extension (present) and capsular invasion (present), but no vascular invasion.
3. The surgical margins are negative.
4. The mitotic rate is 10 per 50 high-power fields, which is consistent with a low-grade tumor.
5. There is no lymph node involvement (N.A.).
6. The tumor has necrosis (present).

According to the AJCC staging system for adrenocortical carcinoma, the T stage is determined by the size of the tumor and the presence of extra-adrenal extension. In this case, the tumor is larger than 8 cm and has extra-adrenal extension, which corresponds to a T3 stage.

Since there is no lymph node involvement (N.A.) and no distant metastases mentioned in the report, the N and M stages are NX and MX, respectively.

Therefore, the overall stage is T3NXMX, which corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
3,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the Cancer.

1. The procedure is an adrenalectomy, which suggests that the tumor is localized to the adrenal gland.
2. The gross description provides the size of the tumor (14x9x5cm, 336g), but it does not indicate any involvement of nearby organs or lymph nodes.
3. The diagnosis is adrenocortical carcinoma, which is a malignant tumor of the adrenal cortex.
4. The report mentions an unusually high proliferation rate, with a KI67 index of 60%. This suggests that the tumor is highly aggressive.
5. The Weiss score, Hough score, and Van Slooten score are all used to assess the degree of malignancy in adrenocortical carcinomas. While these scores are high, they do not provide direct information about the tumor stage.

Based on the information provided, there is no evidence of lymph node involvement, distant metastases, or invasion of nearby organs. The tumor appears to be localized to the adrenal gland.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
4,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Primary Tumor (pT): The report states pT1, which means the tumor is 5 cm or less in greatest dimension, with no extra-adrenal invasion.

2. Regional Lymph Nodes (pN): The report states pNO, which means there is no regional lymph node metastasis.

3. Distant Metastasis (pM): The report states ""Not applicable"", which implies there is no distant metastasis.

Based on the TNM descriptors, we have pT1, pNO, and pM0 (implied). According to the AJCC 7th Edition staging system for adrenal cortical carcinoma, this corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
5,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions a ""251 gram, 8.6 x 7.1 x 6.3 cm"" mass in the right adrenal gland, which is a primary tumor site.
2. The tumor is described as ""confined to the adrenal gland without extraglandular extension"", indicating that it has not invaded beyond the adrenal gland.
3. There is no mention of lymph node involvement or distant metastases.
4. The report also includes a biopsy of the left lobe of the liver, which shows ""benign hepatic parenchyma with steatosis, negative for carcinoma"", indicating that there is no liver metastasis.

Based on these findings, the tumor is localized to the adrenal gland and has not spread to lymph nodes or distant sites. According to the AJCC staging system, this corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
