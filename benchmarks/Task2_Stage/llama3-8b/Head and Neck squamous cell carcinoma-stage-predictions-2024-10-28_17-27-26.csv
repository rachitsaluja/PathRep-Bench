(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The patient has a diagnosis of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, with a histologic grade of moderately differentiated. The tumor is staged as pT4a, indicating that it invades the epiglottic cartilage and extends to the hyoid bone. The lymph nodes are positive for metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, with extracapsular extension in some of the nodes.

The patient has a high-risk tumor, with a large primary tumor size (3.9 cm x 3.8 cm x 1.6 cm) and extracapsular extension in multiple lymph nodes. The tumor also invades the epiglottic cartilage and extends to the hyoid bone, which are both considered high-risk features.

Based on the AJCC staging system, the patient's tumor is staged as pT4a, pN2c, pMx. The pT4a component indicates that the tumor invades the epiglottic cartilage and extends to the hyoid bone, which is a high-risk feature. The pN2c component indicates that the tumor has metastasized to multiple lymph nodes with extracapsular extension, which is also a high-risk feature.

Therefore, the answer is:

{""stage"" : Stage IV}"
1,"## Model generated chain of thought explanation

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, I will first analyze the pathology report to identify the tumor characteristics and extent of disease.

The report states that the tumor is a poorly differentiated squamous carcinoma that invades bone and has lymphatic and perineural invasion. This suggests that the tumor has a high degree of aggressiveness and has spread to surrounding tissues.

The report also mentions that the tumor is close to the margin of resection, which indicates that the tumor has not been completely removed and may have residual disease.

The report does not provide information on the tumor size, but it does mention that the tumor involves the floor of the mouth and expands into the anterior soft tissue. This suggests that the tumor is likely to be of significant size.

Based on these findings, I would conclude that the patient has Stage IV cancer. The presence of lymphatic and perineural invasion, as well as the close proximity of the tumor to the margin of resection, suggests that the tumor has spread to distant sites and has a high likelihood of recurrence.

Therefore, the answer is:
{""stage"" : Stage IV}"
2,"## Model-generated chain of thought explanation

First, I will identify the key features of the pathology report that are relevant to staging:

* The tumor is a moderately differentiated keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma, 4.0 cm in greatest dimension.
* The tumor extends to within 1 mm of the deep aspect of the medial margin, indicating close proximity to the margin.
* The regional lymph nodes are involved, with metastasis in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes, none more than 6 cm in greatest dimension.
* There is focal extranodal extension of nodal tumor.
* The distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Next, I will apply the AJCC staging criteria for oral cavity cancer:

* The tumor size is 4.0 cm, which falls within the T2 category.
* The tumor has extended to within 1 mm of the deep aspect of the medial margin, which indicates close proximity to the margin and would likely be classified as T2a.
* The regional lymph nodes are involved, with metastasis in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes, which would be classified as N2b.
* The presence of focal extranodal extension would likely be classified as pN2b.

Based on these findings, the patient's stage would be:

* T2a (tumor size 4.0 cm, close proximity to the margin)
* N2b (metastasis in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes, focal extranodal extension)
* M0 (distant metastasis cannot be assessed)

Therefore, the answer is:

3,"## Answer

(model generated chain of thought explanation)

First, I will analyze the pathology report to identify the key information related to the tumor and lymph nodes.

The tumor is an invasive keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma, well-differentiated, with a size of 1.9 cm, and it is located in the right tongue. The tumor is unifocal, and there is no evidence of angiolymphatic invasion, perineural invasion, or bone invasion.

The lymph nodes are negative for carcinoma, with 24 lymph nodes examined, and there is no evidence of metastatic carcinoma in the lymph nodes.

The AJCC Pathologic Stage is pT1 pNO, which indicates that the tumor is limited to the primary site (T1) and there is no evidence of nodal metastasis (pNO).

Based on the information provided, the patient does not meet the criteria for Stage III or Stage IV, as there is no evidence of nodal metastasis or distant metastasis.

Therefore, the answer is:

{""stage"" : Stage II}"
4,"## Answer

(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The patient has a squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx, specifically in the retromolar trigone region. The tumor is 3.5 cm in greatest dimension, which falls within the pT2 category. The tumor is poorly differentiated, which is a high-grade feature. The lymph nodes examined were 27, and none of them were involved, which is consistent with pNO.

The patient does not have distant metastasis, as indicated by pM. The tumor margins are negative for tumor, which is a favorable feature.

Based on the AJCC staging system, the patient's tumor is classified as Stage II (pT2, pNO, pM0). The tumor is larger than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension, and it has not spread to the lymph nodes or distant sites.

Therefore, the answer is:

{""stage"" : Stage II}"
5,"## Answer

(model generated chain of thought explanation)

First, I will identify the T stage based on the pathology report. The report states that the tumor is 2.6 x 2.6 x 1.0 cm in size, infiltrating the subglottal and supraglottal regions, which suggests that the tumor is larger than 2 cm in greatest dimension. Therefore, the T stage is likely to be T2.

Next, I will identify the N stage. The report states that there is no evidence of vascular and nerve invasion, and sinus histiocytosis lymphonodorum No I (Delphian) is negative, which suggests that there is no evidence of lymph node metastasis. Therefore, the N stage is likely to be N0.

Finally, I will identify the M stage. The report does not mention any evidence of distant metastasis, so the M stage is likely to be M0.

Based on the T, N, and M stages, the AJCC stage is likely to be Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage II}"
6,"## Model-generated chain of thought explanation

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, I will first analyze the pathology report to identify the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and extracapsular extension.

The tumor size is approximately 5.0 x 3.0 cm, which is considered T3.

The lymph node involvement is as follows:

* Left neck dissection: 5/42 positive lymph nodes, with extracapsular extension present in level 3 and level 4.
* Right neck dissection: 0/20 positive lymph nodes.

The presence of extracapsular extension in level 3 and level 4 lymph nodes indicates that the cancer has spread beyond the lymph node capsule, which is a poor prognostic factor.

Based on the above information, the cancer is considered to be N2c (extracapsular extension in multiple lymph nodes).

The report does not mention any distant metastases, so the cancer is considered to be M0.

Using the AJCC staging system, the T3 tumor size, N2c lymph node involvement, and M0 distant metastases suggest that the patient has Stage IV cancer.

First, I will analyze the pathology report to identify the key features that will help me determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

The report states that the tumor is a squamous cell carcinoma, keratinizing, and moderately differentiated. This suggests that the tumor is likely to be a primary tumor of the larynx.

The tumor size is 4 cm x 2 cm, which is greater than 2 cm in greatest dimension, indicating that it is a T2 tumor.

The report also states that the tumor extends to the deep muscles of the tongue, which is an extralaryngeal extension, indicating that it is a T4 tumor.

The lymph nodes are positive for metastasis, specifically cervical lymph node 1/4, indicating that the tumor has spread to the regional lymph nodes, which is an N1 disease.

The margins are uninvolved, indicating that the tumor has not invaded the surrounding tissues.

Based on these findings, I can determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

The T stage is T4, the N stage is N1, and the M stage is M0 (since there is no evidence of distant metastasis). Therefore, the AJCC stage is Stage IV.

The patient has a squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, with a tumor size of 5.5 cm in greatest dimension and a thickness of 2.5 cm. The tumor is moderately differentiated and has perineural invasion. The lymph nodes in the neck are involved, with 8 out of 59 lymph nodes examined showing metastatic disease. The largest involved lymph node measures 3.1 cm, and extranodal invasion is present.

The patient's pathology report indicates that the tumor is T3 (tumor size > 4 cm in greatest dimension) and N2c (metastasis in bilateral or contralateral lymph nodes, none more than 6 cm in greatest dimension). The patient's stage is therefore pT3N2c.

The patient's stage is Stage IV, as the tumor has spread to the lymph nodes in the neck and the patient has distant metastasis.

The patient has a poorly differentiated non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma of the right pyriform sinus, which has invaded the lateral wall of the larynx without bone invasion. The tumor margins are free of tumor.

The pathology report indicates that the patient has metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in multiple lymph nodes, including level II, III, and IV lymph nodes on the left side, and level III lymph nodes on the right side.

Based on the AJCC staging system, the patient's tumor is considered T3 (Tumor > 4 cm in greatest dimension) and has metastasis to lymph nodes (N1-3). The patient does not have distant metastasis (M0).

10,"## Model generated chain of thought explanation

The pathology report describes an invasive moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the pharynx, with lymphovascular invasion and metastatic disease in multiple lymph nodes. The tumor is 4.5 cm in maximum dimension, and there are two peritumoral deposits of squamous cell carcinoma, possibly representing two completely replaced lymph nodes.

The report also mentions that the margins are free of tumor, and there is no tumor present in the thyroid gland or vocal cords.

To determine the AJCC stage, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and presence of distant metastasis.

The tumor size is 4.5 cm, which is greater than 2 cm, but less than 4 cm, which falls into the T2 category.

The lymph node involvement is as follows: there is metastatic disease in 1 of 10 right cervical lymph nodes (level I) and 5 of 10 left cervical lymph nodes (levels I, II, and III). This is considered N2b disease.

There is no mention of distant metastasis, so we can assume that the disease has not spread to distant organs.

Based on the above information, the AJCC stage would be Stage III, as the tumor is T2, and there is N2b lymph node involvement.

First, I will analyze the pathology report to identify the key features of the tumor. The report states that the tumor is a squamous cell carcinoma, keratinizing type, with a histologic grade of well-differentiated. This suggests that the tumor is likely to be a low-grade cancer.

Next, I will examine the tumor extent. The report states that the tumor is localized, but does not specify the extent of the tumor. However, the fact that the tumor is ulcerated and involves all parts of the larynx suggests that it may be a larger tumor.

The report also states that there is no evidence of lymph node involvement, which is a good prognostic factor. Additionally, the margins are uninvolved, which suggests that the tumor has not spread to the surrounding tissue.

Based on these findings, I would conclude that the patient has a Stage III cancer. The tumor is localized, but it is a larger tumor that involves all parts of the larynx, and there is no evidence of lymph node involvement. Therefore, the answer is:

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The patient has a squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, specifically in the supraglottis with extension into the glottis.
2. The tumor is moderately differentiated (G2) and invades the mucosa of the region outside the supraglottis (pT2).
3. The tumor also invades the epiglottic cartilage, but the thyroid cartilage is uninvolved.
4. The patient has bilateral lymph node metastases, with one lymph node measuring 11mm in level 2 and another measuring 2.2cm in level 3.
5. The patient also has extranodal extension of metastatic disease in the soft tissue away from the involved lymph node.
6. The patient has no evidence of distant metastases.

Based on the AJCC staging system, the patient's tumor is classified as pT2, and the lymph node metastases are classified as pN2c. The patient's stage is therefore Stage III, as the tumor has invaded the mucosa of the region outside the supraglottis and has bilateral lymph node metastases with extranodal extension."

The patient has been diagnosed with invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the buccal mucosa, extending to the skin, with a tumor size of 4 cm. The pathology report indicates that the tumor is moderately differentiated and has invaded the skin, but there is no evidence of angiolymphatic invasion or perineural invasion.

The report also states that the margins are free of carcinoma, and the lymph nodes examined (45) are all negative for tumor involvement. This suggests that the tumor has not spread to the regional lymph nodes.

Based on the TNM staging system, the primary tumor (pT) is classified as pT4a, indicating that the tumor has invaded the skin and is greater than 4 cm in size. The regional lymph nodes (pN) are classified as pNO, indicating that there is no evidence of lymph node involvement. The distant metastasis (pM) is classified as pMX, indicating that there is no evidence of distant metastasis.

Given the above information, the patient's stage is likely Stage IV, as the tumor has invaded the skin and is greater than 4 cm in size, and there is no evidence of lymph node or distant metastasis involvement.

First, I will analyze the pathology report to identify the key information about the tumor. The report states that the patient has invasive squamous cell carcinoma, moderately differentiated, in both the right and left aryepiglottic folds of the larynx. The tumor extends into adjacent cartilage in one of the folds.

Next, I will consider the AJCC staging criteria for laryngeal cancer. According to the AJCC, the T category is determined by the size and extent of the primary tumor. For T1, the tumor is limited to the epithelium or extends into the subepithelial connective tissue. For T2, the tumor extends into the vocal cord or the surrounding tissues. For T3, the tumor extends into the cartilage or the surrounding tissues. For T4, the tumor extends into the surrounding tissues or the thyroid gland.

Based on the pathology report, the tumor extends into adjacent cartilage, which suggests a T3 category.

The N category is determined by the presence or absence of lymph node metastasis. The report does not mention lymph node metastasis, so I will assume that the N category is N0.

The M category is determined by the presence or absence of distant metastasis. The report does not mention distant metastasis, so I will assume that the M category is M0.

Therefore, the patient's AJCC stage is T3N0M0, which corresponds to Stage III.

Next, I will assess the lymph node involvement. The pathology report states that there is metastasis in one lymph node (1/1) with capsular involvement and desmoplasia, indicating N1 disease. Additionally, there are two lymph nodes without capsular involvement among eleven lymph nodes (2/11), indicating N2 disease.

First, I will analyze the pathology report to identify the key features of the tumor and its spread.

The tumor is a squamous cell carcinoma, moderately differentiated, with a maximum tumor dimension of 6.0 cm. It is present at the supero-anterior lip and buccal mucosal margins, and is close (0.2 cm) to the infero-anterior soft tissue margin. The tumor also shows perineural invasion.

The lymph nodes in the right neck, level IA, IB, II-IV, are involved, with six of forty-six lymph nodes (6/46) showing metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. The largest involved lymph node measures 3.5 cm. There is extensive extracapsular extension present.

Based on the T and N stages, the tumor is classified as pT3 (tumor more than 4 cm in greatest dimension) and pN2b (metastasis in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes, none more than 6 cm in greatest dimension).

Therefore, the patient has Stage III cancer.

(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The patient has been diagnosed with invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, poorly differentiated, with perineural invasion. The pathology report provides information about the tumor size, location, and margins, as well as the presence of lymph node metastasis.

The tumor size is 1.9 cm, which is considered small. The tumor is located in the left tongue, and the margins are free of tumor. The presence of perineural invasion suggests that the tumor has invaded the nerves, which is a poor prognostic factor.

The lymph node metastasis is present in one of 27 lymph nodes examined, which is considered a single positive lymph node. The lymph node is 0.5 cm in size, which is considered small.

Based on the AJCC staging system, the patient's tumor is classified as pT1 (small tumor size, <2 cm) and pN1 (single positive lymph node). The presence of perineural invasion and lymph node metastasis suggests that the patient has a higher risk of recurrence and distant metastasis.

Therefore, the answer is:

{""stage"" : Stage IV}

The patient's tumor is classified as Stage IV due to the presence of lymph node metastasis and perineural invasion, which indicates a high risk of recurrence and distant metastasis."

(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The patient has a well-differentiated invasive squamous carcinoma of the tongue, with a tumor size of 2.8 cm in the largest dimension, and a depth of invasion of 1.3 cm. The tumor has infiltrative borders with thick cords of more than 4 cells, and there is focal perineural invasion. The lymph nodes in the right neck dissection, levels Ia, Ib, II, III, and IV, are all negative for tumor.

Based on the AJCC staging system, the tumor is classified as T2 (tumor size > 2 cm, but ≤ 4 cm, and depth of invasion > 1 cm, but ≤ 5 cm). The lymph nodes are classified as N0 (no lymph node metastasis).

The patient's stage is determined by combining the T and N categories. Since the patient has a T2 tumor and N0 lymph nodes, the stage is Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage II}"
33,"## Answer

(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, I will first analyze the pathology report and identify the relevant information.

The patient has a non-keratinizing poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the right tonsil, with a tumor size of 2.7 x 2.6 x 0.7 cm. The tumor is positive at the deep and superior margins, but negative at the lateral and medial margins.

The lymph nodes examined were 49, with 2 positive for metastasis. The largest positive lymph node was 4 mm in greatest dimension.

Based on the AJCC staging manual, 7th edition, the patient's tumor is classified as pT2, as it measures more than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension.

The patient has regional lymph node metastasis, with 2 positive lymph nodes in Level II, which is classified as pN2b.

Therefore, the patient's stage is Stage III.

34,"## Model generated chain of thought explanation

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, I will follow the guidelines outlined by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC). The pathology report provides information about the tumor size, location, and extent of invasion.

First, I will identify the T category based on the tumor size and location. The tumor size is 2.6 x 2.2 x 2.1 cm, which is greater than 4 cm in greatest dimension. According to the AJCC guidelines, this would correspond to a T3 category.

Next, I will assess the N category based on the presence or absence of lymph node metastasis. The report does not mention lymph node involvement, so I will assume that the N category is N0.

Finally, I will evaluate the M category based on the presence or absence of distant metastasis. The report does not mention distant metastasis, so I will assume that the M category is M0.

Based on the T3N0M0 classification, the patient would be classified as Stage III.

(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The patient has a total laryngectomy and bilateral neck dissection for a supraglottic squamous cell carcinoma. The pathology report indicates that the tumor is 4.5 cm in maximum dimension, moderately differentiated, and has perineural and angiolymphatic invasion. The surgical margins are free of tumor.

The report also states that one of 56 lymph nodes examined is positive for metastatic moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, and the lymph node is located at level 3. This suggests that the tumor has spread to the lymph nodes.

Based on the TNM staging system, the T stage is pT4a, indicating that the tumor is greater than 4 cm in maximum dimension and invades the thyroid cartilage. The N stage is pN2a, indicating that there is metastasis to a single lymph node. The M stage is pMX, indicating that there is no distant metastasis.

Therefore, the patient has Stage IV cancer, as the tumor has spread to the lymph nodes and has invaded the thyroid cartilage.

Therefore, the answer is:

First, I will identify the tumor location, size, and grade. The tumor is located in the tonsillar bed, portion of mandible, and salivary gland, and it is 3.5 cm in greatest dimension. The tumor is moderately differentiated and invades the underlying skeletal muscle and minor salivary gland tissue.

Next, I will assess the lymph node involvement. The pathology report states that there are 26 lymph nodes submitted, and one of them contains metastatic carcinoma. The lymph nodes are from levels II and III, and there is no evidence of extracapsular soft tissue extension.

The report also mentions that the tumor extends to within 0.1 cm of the anterior soft tissue resection margin, 0.1 cm of the cauterized inferomedial soft tissue resection margin, 0.2 cm of the deep soft tissue resection margin, 0.4 cm of the posterior soft tissue mucosal resection margin, and 0.9 cm of the superolateral soft tissue resection margin. This suggests that the tumor has invaded the surrounding soft tissue.

Based on the above information, I conclude that the patient has Stage III cancer. The tumor is larger than 2 cm, and it has invaded the surrounding soft tissue. Additionally, there is lymph node involvement, which is a characteristic of Stage III cancer.

Therefore, the answer is:

{""stage"" : Stage III}"

The pathology report describes a patient with a squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue and pharynx, with metastatic disease in one of the two lymph nodes. The tumor is moderately differentiated and has focal perineural invasion. The margins are free of tumor.

The report also mentions that the tumor has infiltrated through soft tissue and is located 4 and 7 cm from the superior soft tissue resection margin. The tumor extends to the sternal bone but does not infiltrate it.

Based on the AJCC staging system, the T stage is T3 (tumor > 4 cm in greatest dimension, infiltrating through soft tissue, and extending to the sternal bone).

The N stage is N1 (one or more lymph nodes involved by tumor).

The M stage is M0 (no distant metastasis).

Therefore, the AJCC stage is Stage III.

38,"## Answer

(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the primary tumor (pT) and regional lymph nodes (pN) based on the pathology report.

The primary tumor is a moderately differentiated HPV-associated squamous cell carcinoma, located in the right hypopharynx with involvement of the right piriform sinus and right vocal cord. The tumor measures 4.7 x 3.7 x 2.6 cm in size and abuts the thyroid cartilage but does not violate it. The tumor is at 0.09mm and 0.15mm from the right lateral hypopharyngeal and base of tongue soft tissue edges/margins, respectively.

According to the pT classification, the tumor is classified as pT3, as it measures more than 4 cm in greatest dimension.

The regional lymph nodes are evaluated as follows:

* Three lymph nodes are positive for metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, with the largest positive lymph node measuring 3.3 cm in greatest dimension.
* The lymph nodes are located in Levels II-IV, with extranodal extension present.
* The number of examined lymph nodes is 71, and the number of involved lymph nodes is 3.

Based on the pN classification, the lymph nodes are classified as pN2b, as there are multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes involved, with the largest positive lymph node measuring more than 3 cm in greatest dimension.

Therefore, the AJCC stage of the cancer is Stage III (C) due to the presence of a T3 primary tumor and N2b regional lymph nodes."

The patient has been diagnosed with oral carcinoma, and the pathology report provides detailed information about the tumor and its characteristics. The tumor is an invasive squamous cell carcinoma, keratinizing, poorly differentiated, exophytic pattern, with a greatest dimension of 3.0 cm. The tumor is located in the left mandible and has invaded the bone.

The report also states that the tumor has not invaded the lymph nodes or the perineural space, and the margins are free of tumor. The patient has undergone a composite resection of the left mandible, and the tumor has been removed along with the surrounding tissue.

Based on the information provided, the patient's tumor is classified as pT4a, which means that it is a primary tumor that is greater than 4 cm in greatest dimension and has invaded the bone. The patient's regional lymph nodes are classified as pNO, which means that they are not involved by tumor. The patient's distant metastasis is classified as pMX, which means that it is not present.

(model generated chain of thought explanation)

First, I will analyze the Tumor Size, which is 5cm. According to the AJCC staging system, T1 is defined as tumor size ≤ 2 cm, T2 is defined as tumor size > 2 cm but ≤ 4 cm, and T3 is defined as tumor size > 4 cm. Since the tumor size is 5cm, it falls into the T3 category.

Next, I will analyze the Lymph Node Status. The pathology report states that there are six lymph nodes with normal morphological structure, but it does not specify whether they are positive for cancer or not. Since the report does not mention any lymph node metastasis, I will assume that the lymph nodes are negative for cancer.

The report also mentions Venous Invasion, which is a feature of T3 tumors. Additionally, the Margins are Absent, indicating that the tumor has invaded the surrounding tissue.

Considering these factors, I would categorize this tumor as T3N0M0, as there is no evidence of lymph node metastasis or distant metastasis.

Therefore, the answer is -

## Model Generated Chain of Thought Explanation

The pathology report describes a patient with squamous cell carcinoma of the mandible, buccal mucosa, and floor of the mouth. The report highlights the presence of multiple positive margins, including the 12 o'clock margin, 5-10 o'clock position, and 6 o'clock position. Additionally, there is evidence of perineural invasion and questionable lymphatic invasion.

The report does not provide information on the tumor size, nodal status, or distant metastasis, which are essential factors in determining the AJCC stage. However, based on the presence of multiple positive margins and perineural invasion, it is likely that the tumor has invaded beyond the primary site and has spread to regional lymph nodes.

Given the lack of information on tumor size, nodal status, and distant metastasis, it is difficult to determine the exact AJCC stage. However, considering the presence of multiple positive margins and perineural invasion, it is likely that the patient has Stage III or Stage IV disease.

(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The patient has a moderately differentiated invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the right tongue, with invasion into the deep tongue muscles and no invasion into the mandible. The tumor measures 5.0 cm in greatest dimension, with all margins negative. The patient has no lymph node metastasis, as all lymph nodes examined were negative for malignancy.

The AJCC staging system for oral cavity cancer is based on the tumor size, lymph node status, and presence of distant metastasis. Since the tumor size is greater than 4 cm, it falls into the T4a category. Since there is no lymph node metastasis, the N category is pN0. The presence of distant metastasis is not mentioned in the report, so the M category is pM0.

According to the AJCC staging system, the patient's tumor is classified as pT4a, pN0, pM0, which corresponds to Stage IVA.

Therefore, the answer is:

First, I will analyze the pathology report to identify the key features of the tumor. The tumor is an invasive squamous cell carcinoma, moderately differentiated, with a size of 3.4 cm in the largest dimension. The tumor invades 1.4 cm deep and has a infiltrative border with thick cords of more than 4 cells. Perineural invasion is present, but moderate, and vascular invasion is absent. Lymphocyte infiltration is moderate.

Next, I will examine the lymph node status. The report states that there are no tumor-positive lymph nodes in levels I, II, III, and IV. This suggests that the tumor has not metastasized to the lymph nodes.

The report also mentions that the tumor approaches the nearest lateral margin to 0.7 cm, the nearest medial margin to 1.0 cm, and the nearest deep margin to 2.2 cm. This suggests that the tumor is close to the resection margins, but not microscopically involved.

Based on the above findings, I will evaluate the tumor stage according to the AJCC staging system. Since the tumor is T3 (tumor size > 4 cm, depth of invasion > 5 mm), N0 (no lymph node metastasis), and M0 (no distant metastasis), the stage would be Stage III.
