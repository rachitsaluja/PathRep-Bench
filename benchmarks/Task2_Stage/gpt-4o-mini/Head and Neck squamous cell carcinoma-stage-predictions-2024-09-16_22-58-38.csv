0,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the TNM classification provided in the report, which states: pT4a pN2c pMx.

1. **Understanding the T (Tumor) classification**:
   - pT4a indicates that the tumor is classified as T4a, which means it is a locally advanced tumor that has invaded surrounding structures. In this case, the tumor has invaded the epiglottic cartilage and the hyoid bone, which supports the T4 classification.

2. **Understanding the N (Node) classification**:
   - pN2c indicates that there are multiple positive lymph nodes involved. Specifically, the report mentions that there are positive lymph nodes in levels 2, 3, and 4 on both sides of the neck, with varying sizes and some with extracapsular extension. This classification suggests significant regional lymph node involvement.

3. **Understanding the M (Metastasis) classification**:
   - pMx indicates that the presence of distant metastasis cannot be assessed based on the current report. This means that there is no definitive evidence of distant spread, but it is not ruled out.

4. **Putting it all together**:
   - According to the AJCC staging system, the combination of T4a (locally advanced), N2c (multiple regional lymph nodes involved), and Mx (unknown distant metastasis) typically corresponds to Stage IV cancer. Specifically, Stage IV is characterized by either T4 tumors or any N classification with evidence of distant metastasis or extensive local invasion.

Given this analysis, the cancer is classified as Stage IV based on the provided TNM classification.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IV""}"
1,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key findings in the report and apply the AJCC staging criteria for squamous cell carcinoma.

1. **Tumor Characteristics**: The report indicates a poorly differentiated squamous carcinoma invading the bone, which suggests a more aggressive tumor. The tumor is described as exophytic and measures approximately 4.0 x 3.5 x 3.0 cm, indicating a significant size.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report states that five lymph nodes were examined, and there was no tumor found in any of them. This is crucial because lymph node involvement is a key factor in staging.

3. **Margins**: The report mentions that the bone margins of resection are free of tumor, and while the tumor is close to the margin of resection, it is still considered free of tumor. The anterior mucosal margin has been disrupted but is also free of tumor.

4. **AJCC Staging Criteria**:
   - **Stage I**: Tumor ≤ 2 cm, no lymph node involvement.
   - **Stage II**: Tumor > 2 cm but ≤ 4 cm, no lymph node involvement.
   - **Stage III**: Tumor > 4 cm or any size with local invasion or lymph node involvement.
   - **Stage IV**: Any size with distant metastasis or extensive local invasion.

Given the tumor size of approximately 4.0 cm, the absence of lymph node involvement, and the fact that the tumor is invading bone but has free margins, we can conclude that the cancer does not meet the criteria for Stage III or IV. 

Since the tumor is greater than 2 cm but less than or equal to 4 cm, and there is no lymph node involvement, the appropriate stage is Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
2,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key components of the report, specifically focusing on the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis.

1. **Tumor Size (pT)**: The report indicates that the tumor is a moderately differentiated keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma with a greatest dimension of 4.0 cm. According to AJCC staging criteria, a tumor size greater than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm is classified as pT2.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN)**: The report states that there are metastases in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes (specifically, 3 out of 51 examined lymph nodes are involved). The classification pN2b indicates that there are metastases in multiple lymph nodes, which is significant for staging.

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM)**: The report indicates pMX, meaning that distant metastasis cannot be assessed. This suggests that there is no evidence of distant spread, which is important for determining the stage.

Now, we can summarize the findings:
- Tumor size: pT2 (4.0 cm)
- Lymph node involvement: pN2b (multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes involved)
- Distant metastasis: pMX (not assessed, but implies no distant spread)

According to the AJCC staging system for oral cavity cancers:
- Stage I: pT1, pN0, pM0
- Stage II: pT2, pN0, pM0
- Stage III: pT3 or pN1, pM0
- Stage IV: pT4 or pN2 or pN3, or any pT with pM1

Given that the patient has a pT2 classification and pN2b classification, this aligns with Stage III criteria, as the presence of multiple lymph node involvement (pN2b) indicates a more advanced stage.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
3,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key findings:

1. **Tumor Size and Type**: The report indicates that the tumor is an invasive keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma with a size of 1.9 cm. According to AJCC staging, T1 tumors are those that are 2 cm or less in greatest dimension.

2. **Extent of Invasion**: The report states that there is no angiolymphatic invasion or perineural invasion identified, which is favorable for staging.

3. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report indicates that 24 lymph nodes were examined, and all were negative for carcinoma (0/24). This means there is no regional lymph node involvement, which is classified as N0.

4. **AJCC Pathologic Stage**: The report explicitly states the AJCC Pathologic Stage as pT1 pNO, which corresponds to a T1 tumor with no regional lymph node involvement.

5. **Stage Classification**: According to the AJCC 8th edition:
   - Stage I is defined as T1 N0 M0.
   - Stage II is defined as T2 N0 M0.
   - Stage III is defined as T3 N0 M0 or T1-3 N1.
   - Stage IV includes any T with N2 or N3, or any M1.

Given that the tumor is classified as pT1 and pN0, it fits the criteria for Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
4,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer based on the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key findings regarding the primary tumor (pT), regional lymph nodes (pN), and distant metastasis (pM).

1. **Primary Tumor (pT)**: The report indicates that the primary tumor is classified as pT2, which means the tumor is more than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension. This is a critical factor in staging.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN)**: The report states pN0, indicating that there is no regional lymph node metastasis. This means that none of the examined lymph nodes (27 in total) showed evidence of cancer.

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM)**: The report mentions that distant metastasis is not applicable, which typically means there is no evidence of cancer spread to distant sites.

Now, we can summarize the findings:
- The tumor is classified as pT2 (size between 2 cm and 4 cm).
- There is no regional lymph node involvement (pN0).
- There is no distant metastasis (pM0).

According to the AJCC staging system for oral cavity cancers:
- **Stage I**: pT1, pN0, pM0
- **Stage II**: pT2, pN0, pM0
- **Stage III**: pT3, pN0, pM0 or pT1-3, pN1, pM0
- **Stage IV**: pT4 or any pT with pN2-3 or pM1

Given that the patient has a pT2 classification with no lymph node involvement and no distant metastasis, this corresponds to **Stage II**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
5,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key components of the report, particularly focusing on the tumor size, extent of invasion, and lymph node involvement.

1. **Tumor Size and Extent (pT)**: The report indicates a tumor size of 2.6 x 2.6 x 1.0 cm located in the glottis region, with invasion into the subglottal and supraglottal regions. The classification given is pT2, which indicates that the tumor is invasive and has extended beyond the vocal cords but is still confined to the larynx.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (pN)**: The report states pNO (Delphian), which means there is no evidence of regional lymph node involvement. This is significant as the presence of lymph node metastasis would elevate the stage.

3. **AJCC Staging Criteria**: According to the AJCC staging system for laryngeal cancer:
   - **Stage I**: Tumor confined to the larynx, ≤ 2 cm, no lymph node involvement.
   - **Stage II**: Tumor > 2 cm but still confined to the larynx, no lymph node involvement.
   - **Stage III**: Tumor of any size with local invasion or with regional lymph node involvement.
   - **Stage IV**: Tumor with extensive local invasion or distant metastasis.

Given that the tumor is classified as pT2 (indicating it is > 2 cm and has invaded beyond the vocal cords) and pN0 (indicating no lymph node involvement), the appropriate classification is Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
6,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer based on the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key findings in relation to the AJCC staging criteria for laryngeal cancer.

1. **Tumor Size and Local Extent**: The report indicates that the tumor is a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma measuring approximately 5.0 x 3.0 cm. It is noted to invade the thyroid cartilage and epiglottic cartilage, with extensive perineural invasion. This suggests a significant local extent of the tumor.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report states that there are 5 out of 42 positive lymph nodes in the left modified radical neck dissection, with the largest metastatic focus measuring 2.2 cm. The presence of multiple positive lymph nodes indicates a higher stage of disease.

3. **Extracapsular Extension**: The report mentions that there is no extracapsular extension present in the lymph nodes, which is an important factor in staging.

4. **AJCC Staging Criteria**:
   - **Stage I**: Tumor confined to the larynx, no lymph node involvement.
   - **Stage II**: Tumor may invade surrounding structures but still confined to the larynx, no lymph node involvement.
   - **Stage III**: Tumor may invade surrounding structures and/or has regional lymph node involvement (1-3 nodes, none larger than 3 cm).
   - **Stage IV**: Tumor invades beyond the larynx (e.g., thyroid cartilage, soft tissues) and/or has extensive lymph node involvement (more than 3 nodes or nodes larger than 3 cm).

Given that the tumor is invading the thyroid and epiglottic cartilage, has extensive perineural invasion, and has multiple positive lymph nodes (5 positive nodes with the largest being 2.2 cm), this indicates a more advanced stage.

Based on these findings, the cancer is classified as Stage IV due to the invasion of surrounding structures and significant lymph node involvement.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IV""}"
7,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key components of the report:

1. **Tumor Size**: The tumor measures 4 x 2 cm. This size is significant in staging.
2. **Histologic Type**: The tumor is identified as squamous cell carcinoma, which is a common type of laryngeal cancer.
3. **Tumor Extent**: The report states that the tumor extends into the deep muscles of the tongue. This indicates a more advanced local invasion.
4. **Lymph Nodes**: There is evidence of metastasis with 1 out of 4 lymph nodes positive for cancer. This suggests that the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes.
5. **Margins**: The margins are reported as uninvolved, which is a positive aspect as it indicates that the cancer has not spread beyond the surgical margins.

Now, we can correlate these findings with the AJCC staging criteria for laryngeal cancer:

- **Stage I**: Tumor confined to the larynx, ≤ 2 cm, no lymph node involvement.
- **Stage II**: Tumor confined to the larynx, > 2 cm but ≤ 4 cm, no lymph node involvement.
- **Stage III**: Tumor of any size with local invasion (e.g., into the deep muscles) or with lymph node involvement (1-3 positive nodes).
- **Stage IV**: Tumor of any size with extensive local invasion or distant metastasis.

Given that the tumor is 4 x 2 cm, extends into the deep muscles of the tongue, and has 1 positive lymph node, it fits the criteria for **Stage III**. The presence of local invasion and lymph node involvement is critical in determining this stage.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
8,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer based on the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key findings in the report and apply the AJCC staging criteria for oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma.

1. **Tumor Size and Local Extent (T)**:
   - The report indicates that the maximum tumor diameter is 5.5 cm and the tumor thickness is 2.5 cm. According to AJCC staging, a tumor greater than 4 cm in greatest dimension is classified as T3. Therefore, we have:
     - pT3: Tumor of the lip or oral cavity more than 4 cm in greatest dimension.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N)**:
   - The report states that there are metastatic squamous cell carcinoma cells in 8 out of 59 examined lymph nodes. The largest involved lymph node measures 3.1 cm, and there is extranodal invasion present. This indicates a significant nodal involvement.
   - According to AJCC criteria, the classification for lymph node involvement is as follows:
     - pN2c: Metastasis in bilateral or contralateral lymph nodes, none more than 6 cm in greatest dimension.
   - Since there is extranodal extension, this further supports a higher stage.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**:
   - The report indicates that distant metastasis cannot be assessed (pMX). This means we cannot classify the cancer as Stage IV based on distant spread.

4. **Combining the Findings**:
   - Based on the findings:
     - T3 (tumor size > 4 cm)
     - N2c (bilateral lymph node involvement with extranodal extension)
     - MX (distant metastasis cannot be assessed)
   - According to AJCC staging, the combination of T3 and N2c typically corresponds to Stage III.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and absence of distant metastasis, the cancer is classified as Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
9,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the findings step by step.

1. **Primary Tumor (T)**: The report indicates a poorly differentiated non-keratinizing squamous carcinoma of the right pyriform sinus measuring 3.5 x 1.5 x 1.1 cm. It involves the lateral wall of the larynx but does not invade bone. According to AJCC staging, this would likely classify as T2 (tumor > 2 cm but ≤ 4 cm, without invasion of surrounding structures).

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N)**: The report shows metastatic squamous carcinoma in multiple lymph nodes:
   - Right Level III: 1 of 10 nodes positive.
   - Left Level II: 3 of 6 nodes positive.
   - Left Level III: 2 of 9 nodes positive.
   - Left Level IV: 3 of 4 nodes positive.
   This indicates extensive lymph node involvement, which suggests N3 (metastasis in 3 or more lymph nodes).

3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, which would classify as M0.

Now, combining these findings:
- T2 (tumor size and local invasion)
- N3 (extensive lymph node involvement)
- M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC staging system, the combination of T2, N3, and M0 corresponds to Stage IV. 

Therefore, the answer is -

10,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key findings in the report and correlate them with the AJCC staging criteria for squamous cell carcinoma of the pharynx.

1. **Tumor Size (T)**: The report indicates that the maximum dimension of the invasive squamous cell carcinoma is 4.5 cm. According to AJCC staging, a tumor size greater than 4 cm is classified as T3.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N)**: The report states that there is metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in 5 of 10 left cervical lymph nodes and 1 of 10 right cervical lymph nodes. This indicates significant lymph node involvement. According to AJCC criteria, involvement of multiple lymph nodes (more than 1) on the same side of the neck is classified as N2b.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: The report does not mention any distant metastasis, which means it is classified as M0.

Now, we can summarize the findings:
- T3 (tumor size > 4 cm)
- N2b (multiple lymph nodes involved on the same side)
- M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC staging system for head and neck cancers, the combination of T3, N2b, and M0 corresponds to Stage III.

11,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key findings regarding the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and any distant metastasis.

1. **Tumor Size (T)**: The report indicates that the squamous cell carcinoma in the left tonsil has a greatest dimension of 5.0 cm. This size classifies it as T4a, which is defined as a tumor that invades adjacent structures.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N)**: The report states that there are metastatic carcinoma present in four of 35 lymph nodes. Specifically, it mentions:
   - 0/7 level IA nodes
   - 0/4 level IIB nodes
   - 1/8 level IIA node
   - 2/8 level III nodes
   - 1/5 level IV nodes
   - 0/2 left facial nodes
   - 0/1 level V node
   The largest positive node is 2.5 cm (level III), and both level III nodes and the level IIA node have extracapsular extension. This indicates significant lymph node involvement, classified as N2b (metastasis in multiple lymph nodes, some with extracapsular extension).

3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: The report indicates ""MX,"" which means that the presence of distant metastasis cannot be assessed. This does not indicate any distant spread.

Based on the AJCC staging system:
- **Stage I**: T1, N0, M0
- **Stage II**: T2, N0, M0 or T1, N1, M0
- **Stage III**: T3, N0, M0 or T1-T2, N2, M0
- **Stage IV**: T4, any N, M0 or any T, N3, M0 or any T, any N, M1

12,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the details given in the report.

1. **Tumor Description**: The report describes a ""dense tumor"" in the larynx that is ""ulcerated."" This indicates that the tumor has penetrated the surface of the larynx, which is a significant factor in staging.

2. **Tumor Size**: The tumor size is reported as 1 x 0 x 1.5 cm. This size is relatively small, but the ulceration and involvement of the larynx are critical factors.

3. **Histologic Type and Grade**: The tumor is identified as ""squamous cell carcinoma, keratinizing, G-1,"" which indicates it is well-differentiated. The grade can influence prognosis but is not a direct factor in staging.

4. **Tumor Extent**: The report states ""localized, NOS"" (not otherwise specified), which suggests that the tumor is confined to the larynx without clear evidence of spread to nearby structures or lymph nodes.

5. **Lymph Nodes and Margins**: The report does not specify lymph node involvement, and the margins are described as ""uninvolved,"" which is a positive sign indicating that the tumor has not spread beyond its original site.

6. **Venous Invasion**: The absence of venous invasion is also a favorable sign, suggesting that the cancer has not spread through the bloodstream.

7. **Involvement of All Parts of the Organ**: The comment about the cancer involving ""all parts of the organ"" suggests a more advanced local involvement, which is a critical factor in staging.

Based on the AJCC staging system for laryngeal cancer:
- **Stage I**: Tumor confined to the larynx, no spread, and less than 2 cm.
- **Stage II**: Tumor larger than 2 cm or with local extension but still confined to the larynx.
- **Stage III**: Tumor with local extension to surrounding structures or involvement of lymph nodes.
- **Stage IV**: Tumor with significant local extension, involvement of adjacent structures, or distant metastasis.

Given that the tumor is ulcerated, involves all parts of the larynx, and is localized without lymph node involvement, it suggests a more advanced stage. The absence of lymph node involvement and the size of the tumor indicate it"
13,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key components of the report, specifically focusing on the T (tumor), N (nodes), and M (metastasis) classifications.

1. **Primary Tumor (T)**: The report indicates that the tumor is classified as pT2. According to AJCC staging for laryngeal cancer, pT2 means that the tumor invades the mucosa of a region outside the supraglottis but does not extend beyond the larynx. This suggests a localized tumor that has not spread extensively.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N)**: The report states pN2c, which indicates that there is metastasis in bilateral lymph nodes, with none larger than 6 cm in greatest dimension. The presence of bilateral lymph node involvement suggests a more advanced stage than if only unilateral nodes were involved.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: The report does not mention any distant metastasis, which would be classified as M0.

Now, we can summarize the findings:
- The tumor is classified as pT2.
- There is bilateral lymph node involvement classified as pN2c.
- There is no distant metastasis (M0).

According to the AJCC staging system for laryngeal cancer:
- Stage I: T1, N0, M0
- Stage II: T2, N0, M0
- Stage III: T3 or T1-2 with N1, M0
- Stage IV: T4 or any T with N2-3, M0 or any M1

Given that the patient has pT2 and pN2c, this fits the criteria for Stage IV, as the presence of bilateral lymph node involvement (N2c) indicates a more advanced stage.

1. **Primary Tumor (pT)**: The report indicates a primary tumor classification of pT4b. According to the AJCC staging system for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, pT4b indicates a tumor that is very large (greater than 4 cm) and has invaded nearby structures, which is characteristic of advanced disease.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN)**: The report states pN0, meaning there is no regional lymph node involvement. This is an important factor as it indicates that the cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes, which is a positive aspect in terms of staging.

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM)**: The report indicates pMX, which means that the presence of distant metastasis is unknown. However, the absence of lymph node involvement suggests that the cancer is likely localized.

4. **Margins**: The report notes that all resection margins are free of tumor, which is favorable and suggests that the tumor was completely removed.

5. **Overall Assessment**: Given that the tumor is classified as pT4b (indicating a large and invasive tumor), but with no lymph node involvement (pN0) and no distant metastasis confirmed (pMX), the overall staging aligns with Stage IV. Specifically, Stage IV is characterized by either a very large primary tumor or significant local invasion, regardless of lymph node involvement.

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key components of the report:

1. **Tumor Size and Depth**: The report indicates that the tumor is a moderately differentiated endophytic squamous cell carcinoma measuring 1 cm in diameter and invasive to a depth of 0.5 cm. According to AJCC staging for oral cavity cancers, T1 is defined as a tumor that is 2 cm or less in greatest dimension.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report states that there is no evidence of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in any of the sentinel lymph nodes examined (Sentinel lymph node #1, #2, #3, and #4). This indicates that there is no regional lymph node involvement, which corresponds to N0 in AJCC staging.

3. **AJCC Pathologic Stage**: The report explicitly mentions ""AJCC pathologic stage: T1, N0."" This confirms that the tumor is classified as T1 (tumor size ≤ 2 cm) and N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis).

Based on this information, we can conclude that the cancer is classified as Stage I, which is characterized by T1 and N0.

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the pathology report, we need to analyze the findings based on the AJCC staging criteria.

1. **Primary Tumor (pT)**: The report indicates a primary tumor size of 3.5 cm, which is classified as pT2 according to AJCC staging. This classification is typically for tumors that are larger than 2 cm but not larger than 4 cm.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN)**: The report states that 1 out of 33 lymph nodes examined is involved with squamous cell carcinoma (pN1). This indicates that there is regional lymph node involvement, which is significant for staging.

3. **Extracapsular Extension**: The report specifies that there is no extravasation of cancer beyond the lymph node capsule, which is an important factor in determining the stage.

4. **Perineural Invasion**: The presence of perineural invasion is noted, which can influence the stage but does not change the classification from pN1.

5. **Final Staging**: The report concludes with a pathologic stage of III (pT2, pN1, pM0), which corresponds to AJCC Stage III. This stage is characterized by a primary tumor that is moderately sized (pT2) and has regional lymph node involvement (pN1).

Based on this analysis, the cancer is classified as AJCC Stage III.

- **Stage III**: pT3 or pT1-2 with pN1, pM0
- **Stage IV**: pT4 or any T with pN2-3 or pM1

Given that the patient has a pT2 tumor with pN1 (lymph node involvement) and pM0 (no distant metastasis), this aligns with the criteria for **Stage III**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
21,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key findings:

1. **Tumor Size and Extent**: The report indicates a tumor classified as pT4a, which means it is a locally advanced tumor that has invaded through the thyroid cartilage and into the anterior soft tissue. This level of invasion suggests a significant extent of disease.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report states that there are no positive lymph nodes (pNO), meaning that the cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes.

3. **Metastasis**: The report indicates pMX, which means that the presence of distant metastasis is unknown. However, since there is no mention of any distant spread, we can infer that it is likely localized.

4. **AJCC Staging**: According to the AJCC staging system for laryngeal cancer:
   - Stage I: Tumor confined to the larynx, no lymph node involvement.
   - Stage II: Tumor extends beyond the larynx but still localized, no lymph node involvement.
   - Stage III: Tumor may involve the larynx and surrounding structures, but no lymph node involvement.
   - Stage IV: Tumor is advanced, with local invasion or lymph node involvement.

Given that the tumor is classified as pT4a (indicating significant local invasion) and there is no lymph node involvement (pNO), this aligns with the criteria for Stage IV cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IV""}"
22,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key features of the tumor and the lymph node involvement.

1. **Tumor Size and Depth of Invasion**: The report indicates that the tumor is 3 cm in size and has a depth of invasion of 1.5 cm. According to AJCC staging for oral cavity cancers, a tumor size of 3 cm typically falls into the T2 category (tumor size > 2 cm but ≤ 4 cm).

2. **Tumor Characteristics**: The tumor is described as moderately differentiated invasive squamous carcinoma with perineural invasion present. The presence of perineural invasion can indicate a more aggressive tumor behavior, which is relevant for staging.

3. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report states that multiple lymph nodes were examined (from levels I, II, and III) and all were negative for tumor involvement. This means there is no regional lymph node metastasis (N0).

4. **Margins**: The deep margin is described as ""close < 2mm,"" which suggests that while there is no invasive carcinoma at the margin, the proximity to the margin could be a concern, but it does not directly affect the staging.

5. **AJCC Staging Summary**:
   - **T**: The tumor is classified as T2 (3 cm in size).
   - **N**: The lymph nodes are classified as N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis).
   - **M**: There is no mention of distant metastasis, so we assume M0.

Based on the AJCC 8th edition staging system for oral cavity cancers:
- T2 N0 M0 corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
23,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the T (tumor), N (nodes), and M (metastasis) classifications.

1. **T Classification**: The report indicates a pT4a classification. According to the AJCC staging system for oral cavity cancers:
   - T4a indicates a tumor that has invaded through the cortical bone and/or has invaded the deep (extrinsic) muscle of the floor of the mouth. This is consistent with the report stating that the tumor destroys the bone in the mandible and infiltrates the skeletal muscles of the floor of the mouth.

2. **N Classification**: The report states pN0, which means there is no regional lymph node involvement. This is significant as it indicates that the cancer has not spread to nearby lymph nodes.

3. **M Classification**: The report indicates M0, meaning there is no distant metastasis. This suggests that the cancer has not spread to other parts of the body.

Given these classifications:
- The presence of a T4a tumor indicates advanced local disease.
- The absence of lymph node involvement (N0) and distant metastasis (M0) suggests that while the local disease is advanced, it has not spread to regional or distant sites.

According to the AJCC staging system:
- Stage I and II are characterized by smaller tumors without significant local invasion or lymph node involvement.
- Stage III typically involves larger tumors or those with lymph node involvement.
- Stage IV is reserved for more advanced disease, including T4 tumors with lymph node involvement or distant metastasis.

Since we have a T4a tumor with N0 and M0, this fits the criteria for Stage IV cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IV""}"
24,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key findings related to the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and any distant metastasis.

1. **Tumor Size and Local Invasion**: The report indicates that the invasive squamous carcinoma has a size of 2.5 cm and is described as having perineural invasion and infiltrative borders. The depth of invasion is noted to be 1.5 cm, which is significant.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report states that multiple lymph nodes were examined (a total of 43 lymph nodes across various levels), and all were negative for tumor involvement (0/43). This indicates that there is no regional lymph node metastasis.

3. **Distant Metastasis**: There is no mention of any distant metastasis in the report, which is crucial for staging.

4. **AJCC Staging Criteria**:
   - **Stage I**: Tumor ≤ 2 cm, no lymph node involvement, no metastasis.
   - **Stage II**: Tumor > 2 cm but ≤ 4 cm, no lymph node involvement, no metastasis.
   - **Stage III**: Any size tumor with lymph node involvement or tumor > 4 cm without lymph node involvement.
   - **Stage IV**: Distant metastasis or extensive local invasion (e.g., invasion of adjacent structures).

Given that the tumor is 2.5 cm (which fits the criteria for Stage II), has no lymph node involvement, and no distant metastasis, we can conclude that the cancer is classified as Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
25,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer based on the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key findings regarding the tumor's characteristics, size, and extent of invasion.

1. **Tumor Type and Differentiation**: The report indicates a diagnosis of moderately differentiated squamous carcinoma. This type of cancer is common in the oral cavity.

2. **Tumor Size**: The tumor measures 5.0 x 3.8 x 3.0 cm. According to AJCC staging, the size of the tumor is an important factor in determining the stage.

3. **Invasion**: The tumor is described as invading the mandible and extending beyond the gingival-buccal sulcus into the subcutaneous tissue and deep dermis of the skin. This indicates a significant level of local invasion.

4. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report states that there is no evidence of metastatic disease in the lymph nodes examined (both left submandibular and right neck dissection). This is crucial because the presence of lymph node metastasis would elevate the stage.

5. **Margins**: The resection margins are reported to be free of tumor, which is a positive sign and suggests that the tumor has been adequately removed.

6. **AJCC Staging Criteria**: Based on the AJCC criteria:
   - **Stage I**: Tumor ≤ 2 cm, no lymph node involvement.
   - **Stage II**: Tumor > 2 cm but ≤ 4 cm, no lymph node involvement.
   - **Stage III**: Tumor > 4 cm or any size with local invasion to adjacent structures, no lymph node involvement.
   - **Stage IV**: Any size with lymph node involvement or distant metastasis.

Given that the tumor is larger than 4 cm and has invaded local structures (mandible and soft tissues), but there is no lymph node involvement, this aligns with the criteria for **Stage III**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
26,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key findings regarding the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and any distant metastasis.

1. **Tumor Size (T)**: The report indicates a ""DEEPLY INVASIVE SQUAMOUS CARCINOMA, MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED"" with a size of 2.8 cm. According to AJCC staging, a tumor size of 2.0 to 4.0 cm typically corresponds to T2.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N)**: The report shows that in the left supraomohyoid neck dissection:
   - Level I: 0/6 lymph nodes involved
   - Level II: 0/1 lymph node involved
   - Level III: 1/16 lymph nodes involved with a microscopic focus of carcinoma.
   This indicates that there is lymph node involvement, specifically at Level III, which suggests N1 (metastasis in 1-3 regional lymph nodes).

3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: There is no mention of any distant metastasis in the report, which would indicate M0.

Now, we can summarize the findings:
- T2 (tumor size 2.8 cm)
- N1 (1 lymph node involved)
- M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC staging system for oral cavity cancers:
- Stage I: T1, N0, M0
- Stage II: T2, N0, M0
- Stage III: T3 or T1-2 with N1, M0
- Stage IV: T4 or any T with N2-3 or M1

Given that the patient has T2, N1, and M0, this corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is -

27,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key findings:

1. **Tumor Size and Type**: The report indicates a well-differentiated invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, measuring 1.5 cm in greatest extent. According to AJCC staging, a tumor size of 2 cm or less is classified as pT1.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report states that 18 lymph nodes were examined from the left neck, and all were negative for malignancy (0/18). This indicates no regional lymph node involvement, which is classified as pN0.

3. **Distant Metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, which would be classified as M0.

4. **Pathologic Staging**: The report explicitly states that these findings correspond to AJCC 6th edition pathologic stage I (pT1N0M0).

Based on this information, the cancer is classified as Stage I, as it meets the criteria for pT1N0M0.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
28,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key findings regarding the tumor's characteristics and the lymph node involvement.

1. **Tumor Size and Extent**: The report indicates that the tumor is classified as pT4a, which means it is a locally advanced tumor. Specifically, it has invaded surrounding structures, including the thyroid cartilage and the pre-epiglottic space. This level of invasion is characteristic of Stage IV cancer.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report states that there are metastatic squamous cell carcinoma findings in the lymph nodes. Specifically, there are 2 positive lymph nodes out of 14 examined on the right side and 1 positive lymph node out of 25 examined on the left side. The presence of metastasis in lymph nodes is classified as pN2c, which indicates multiple lymph nodes are involved but without extralymphatic spread.

3. **AJCC Staging Criteria**: According to the AJCC staging system for laryngeal cancer:
   - Stage I: Tumor confined to the larynx without lymph node involvement.
   - Stage II: Tumor extends beyond the larynx but without lymph node involvement.
   - Stage III: Tumor with local invasion and/or single lymph node involvement.
   - Stage IV: Tumor with extensive local invasion and/or multiple lymph nodes involved.

Given that the tumor is classified as pT4a and pN2c, it meets the criteria for Stage IV due to the extensive local invasion and the involvement of multiple lymph nodes.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IV""}"
29,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer based on the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key components of the report in relation to the AJCC staging criteria for laryngeal cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (T)**: The report indicates a tumor size of 5.5 cm with invasion into the mucosa, cartilage, and skeletal muscle. This suggests a T4 classification, as T4 tumors are defined as those that invade through the larynx and into surrounding structures.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N)**: The report states that there is one lymph node with squamous cell carcinoma metastasis that shows capsular involvement (1/1), and two lymph nodes with metastasis without capsular involvement among eleven lymph nodes (2/11). The presence of metastasis in lymph nodes with capsular involvement typically indicates a more advanced stage. This would classify the nodal involvement as N3.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, which would classify the M category as M0.

Based on the above analysis:
- The T classification is T4 (due to extensive local invasion).
- The N classification is N3 (due to the presence of metastasis with capsular involvement).
- The M classification is M0 (no distant metastasis).

According to the AJCC staging system for laryngeal cancer:
- Stage IV is characterized by T4 and any N classification, or any T with N3, or any M1.

Given that we have T4 and N3, the cancer is classified as Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is -

30,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer based on the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key findings in the report and correlate them with the AJCC staging criteria.

1. **Tumor Size (T)**: The report indicates that the primary tumor in the buccal mucosa has a maximum dimension of 6.0 cm. According to AJCC staging, a tumor greater than 4 cm is classified as T3.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N)**: The report states that there are 6 involved lymph nodes out of 46 examined, with the largest lymph node measuring 3.5 cm. The presence of multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes involved (6 nodes) and the size of the largest node (3.5 cm) classifies this as N2b.

3. **Extracapsular Extension**: The report mentions extensive extracapsular extension of the nodal tumor, which is an important factor in staging. The presence of extracapsular extension typically indicates a more advanced stage.

4. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: The report indicates that distant metastasis cannot be assessed (pMX), which means we cannot classify it as Stage IV based on distant spread.

Based on the above findings:
- The tumor is classified as T3 (greater than 4 cm).
- The lymph node involvement is classified as N2b (multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes involved).
- There is no evidence of distant metastasis.

According to the AJCC staging system, the combination of T3, N2b, and M0 (no distant metastasis) corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is -

31,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key findings:

1. **Tumor Size (T)**: The report indicates that the tumor is classified as pT1, which means it is a small tumor (≤ 2 cm in greatest dimension). This corresponds to Stage I in the AJCC staging system.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N)**: The report states pN1, indicating that there is involvement of 1 regional lymph node. This is significant because the presence of lymph node involvement typically raises the stage.

3. **Metastasis (M)**: The report does not indicate any distant metastasis (pMX), which means that there is no evidence of cancer spread to distant sites.

Based on the AJCC staging criteria for oral cavity cancers:
- Stage I is defined as a tumor that is ≤ 2 cm in greatest dimension and no regional lymph node involvement.
- Stage II is defined as a tumor that is > 2 cm but ≤ 4 cm with no regional lymph node involvement or ≤ 2 cm with regional lymph node involvement.
- Stage III is defined as a tumor that is > 4 cm or any size with regional lymph node involvement.
- Stage IV is defined as any tumor with distant metastasis or extensive local invasion.

Given that the tumor is pT1 (≤ 2 cm) and pN1 (1 lymph node involved), the cancer fits the criteria for Stage II, as it has lymph node involvement despite being a small tumor.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
32,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key findings related to tumor size, depth of invasion, lymph node involvement, and any distant metastasis.

1. **Tumor Size and Depth of Invasion**: The report indicates that the invasive squamous carcinoma has a size of 2.8 cm and a depth of invasion of 1.3 cm. According to AJCC staging criteria for oral cavity cancers:
   - Stage I: Tumor ≤ 2 cm and no nodal involvement.
   - Stage II: Tumor > 2 cm but ≤ 4 cm and no nodal involvement.
   - Stage III: Tumor > 4 cm or any size with regional lymph node involvement.
   - Stage IV: Any size with extensive local invasion or distant metastasis.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report states that all examined lymph nodes (0/7, 0/16, 0/9, 0/21) are negative for tumor involvement. This indicates that there is no regional lymph node metastasis.

3. **Conclusion Based on Findings**:
   - The tumor is well differentiated, measuring 2.8 cm, which places it in the criteria for Stage II (tumor > 2 cm but ≤ 4 cm).
   - There is no lymph node involvement, which is consistent with Stage II criteria.

Given these points, the most appropriate AJCC stage for this patient's cancer is Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is -

33,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key findings related to the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and any distant metastasis.

1. **Primary Tumor (pT)**: The report indicates that the tumor is classified as pT2, which means the tumor is more than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension. The tumor size is reported as 2.7 x 2.6 x 0.7 cm, which fits this classification.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN)**: The report states that there are metastatic squamous cell carcinoma findings in 2 out of 18 level II lymph nodes. This indicates that there is regional lymph node involvement. According to the AJCC staging system, this corresponds to pN2b, which is defined as metastasis in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes, none more than 6 cm in greatest dimension.

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM)**: The report indicates that there is no distant metastasis (pM0).

Now, we can summarize the findings:
- Tumor size: pT2
- Lymph node involvement: pN2b
- Distant metastasis: pM0

According to the AJCC staging system:
- Stage I: pT1, pN0, pM0
- Stage II: pT2, pN0, pM0 or pT1, pN1, pM0
- Stage III: pT3 or pT2, pN1 or pN2a, pM0
- Stage IV: pT4 or pN3 or pM1

Given that the patient has a pT2 and pN2b, this corresponds to Stage III, as it meets the criteria of having a tumor size of more than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm and multiple lymph node involvement.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
34,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key components of the report:

1. **Tumor Size and Local Invasion**: The report indicates that the tumor is a squamous carcinoma measuring 2.6 x 2.2 x 2.1 cm. It is noted to be invading the mandible and infiltrating skeletal muscle, which suggests a more advanced local invasion.

2. **Margins**: The report states that the margins of resection are free of carcinoma, which is a positive sign. However, it also mentions that the tumor extends to the right lingual surgical resection margin, indicating that there was involvement at that margin before the new right lingual margin was assessed.

3. **Perineural Involvement**: The presence of perineural involvement is significant as it often indicates a higher stage of cancer due to the potential for spread along nerve pathways.

4. **AJCC Staging Criteria**: 
   - **Stage I**: Tumor ≤ 2 cm, no regional or distant spread.
   - **Stage II**: Tumor > 2 cm but ≤ 4 cm, no regional or distant spread.
   - **Stage III**: Tumor > 4 cm or any size with perineural invasion or involvement of lymph nodes.
   - **Stage IV**: Any size with extensive local invasion, involvement of lymph nodes, or distant metastasis.

Given that the tumor is moderately differentiated, measures 2.6 cm, has perineural involvement, and invades skeletal muscle, it does not fit the criteria for Stage I or Stage II. The perineural involvement and invasion of skeletal muscle suggest a more advanced stage, likely Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is -

35,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key findings related to the tumor's characteristics and staging criteria.

1. **Tumor Size and Extent (pT)**: The report indicates a pathologic T stage of pT4a. This classification means that the tumor is invasive and has extended beyond the larynx into adjacent structures, specifically the thyroid cartilage. T4 tumors are typically classified as advanced and indicate a more severe stage.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (pN)**: The report states a pathologic N stage of pN2a, which indicates that there is regional lymph node involvement. Specifically, it mentions that one out of fifty-six lymph nodes examined is positive for cancer, which is significant but does not indicate extensive lymph node involvement.

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM)**: The report indicates pMX, which means that the presence of distant metastasis cannot be assessed. This does not confirm any distant spread of cancer, but it also does not rule it out.

4. **Overall Staging**: According to the AJCC staging system:
   - Stage I and II typically involve smaller tumors without significant lymph node involvement.
   - Stage III involves larger tumors or those with regional lymph node involvement but without distant metastasis.
   - Stage IV is characterized by more extensive local invasion (T4) and/or significant lymph node involvement (N2 or higher) and/or distant metastasis.

Given that the tumor is classified as pT4a and pN2a, this indicates a significant local invasion and regional lymph node involvement, which aligns with Stage IV criteria.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N)**: The report states that there is metastatic carcinoma to 1 out of 11 level II lymph nodes, and no metastatic carcinoma in level III lymph nodes. This indicates that there is regional lymph node involvement, which corresponds to N1 (metastasis to 1-3 regional lymph nodes).

3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: The report does not indicate any evidence of distant metastasis, which would classify this as M0.

4. **Combining the Findings**: Based on the findings:

The tumor is described as an irregular ulcero-nodular lesion on the tongue, measuring 2.0 x 1.5 cm on the surface and 1.2 cm in depth. It is located 1.0 cm from the anterior resection margin and 0.5 cm from the deep soft tissue margin. 

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report states that metastatic squamous cell carcinoma is present in 1 of 2 lymph nodes. This is a critical factor in staging, as lymph node involvement typically indicates a higher stage.

3. **Bone Involvement**: The tumor extends to the sternal bone but does not infiltrate it. This suggests that while there is local invasion, it does not meet the criteria for distant metastasis.

4. **AJCC Staging Criteria**: 
   - **Stage I**: Tumor ≤ 2 cm, no lymph node involvement.
   - **Stage II**: Tumor > 2 cm, no lymph node involvement.

1. **Primary Tumor (pT)**: The report indicates that the tumor is classified as pT3, which means the tumor measures more than 4 cm in greatest dimension or has fixation of the hemilarynx or extension to the esophagus. In this case, the tumor measures 4.7 x 3.7 x 2.6 cm and is located in the right hypopharynx, with involvement of the right piriform sinus and right vocal cord. This classification indicates a more advanced local disease.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN)**: The report states that there are 3 positive lymph nodes out of 71 examined, with the largest positive lymph node measuring 3.3 cm. This is classified as pN2b, which indicates metastasis in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes, none more than 6 cm in greatest dimension.

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM)**: The report indicates that there is no distant metastasis (pM0).

Based on the AJCC staging system:
- **Stage I**: Tumor limited to one subsite of hypopharynx and/or 2 cm or less in greatest dimension.

1. **Primary Tumor (pT)**: The report indicates that the primary tumor is classified as pT4a. According to the AJCC staging system for oral cavity cancers, pT4a indicates a tumor that is locally advanced, with invasion into adjacent structures (in this case, the mandible).

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN)**: The report states pN0, meaning that there is no regional lymph node involvement. This is significant because the absence of lymph node metastasis typically suggests a lower stage.

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM)**: The report indicates pMX, which means that the status of distant metastasis is unknown. However, since there is no evidence of distant spread mentioned, we can infer that it is likely not present.

4. **Summary of Findings**: 
   - The tumor is classified as pT4a (locally advanced).
   - There is no lymph node involvement (pN0).
   - There is no evidence of distant metastasis (pM is unknown but likely negative).

1. **Tumor Size**: The report indicates that the tumor is 5 cm in size. According to AJCC staging for oral cavity cancers, the size of the primary tumor (T) is crucial for staging.

2. **Tumor Extent**: The tumor is described as ""localized, NOS,"" which suggests that it has not spread beyond the primary site significantly.

3. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report mentions that there are six lymph nodes with a ""normal morphological structure,"" indicating that there is no lymph node involvement (N0).

4. **Venous Invasion**: The presence of venous invasion is noted, which can be a factor in staging but does not necessarily change the T or N classification directly.

5. **Margins**: The report states that margins are absent, which typically indicates that the tumor may not have been completely excised, but this is more relevant for treatment considerations than for staging.

Now, we can summarize the findings:
- Tumor size (T): 5 cm (T2 according to AJCC staging for oral cavity cancers)
- Lymph nodes (N): No involvement (N0)
- Distant metastasis (M): Not mentioned, so we assume M0.

Based on the AJCC staging system:

There are also mentions of severe dysplasia and carcinoma in situ at the margins of resection.

2. **Tumor Characteristics**: The presence of poorly differentiated squamous carcinoma suggests a more aggressive tumor type. The report notes that the margins of resection are free of carcinoma, which is a positive sign, but there are indications of perineural invasion and questionable lymphatic involvement.

3. **Tumor Size and Invasion**: The report describes a lesion measuring 8.0 cm in the mandible, which is significant. The AJCC staging system considers tumor size and local invasion when determining the stage. The absence of gross evidence of tumor invasion into bone is noted, which is relevant for staging.

4. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report does not provide clear evidence of lymph node involvement, but it does mention questionable lymphatics. This uncertainty could impact the staging.

5. **AJCC Staging Criteria**: 
   - **Stage I**: Tumor ≤ 2 cm, no lymph node involvement, no metastasis.
   - **Stage II**: Tumor > 2 cm but ≤ 4 cm, no lymph node involvement, no metastasis.
   - **Stage III**: Tumor > 4 cm or any size with local invasion or lymph node involvement.
   - **Stage IV**: Any size with distant metastasis or extensive local invasion.

Given the size of the tumor (8.0 cm) and the presence of perineural invasion, the tumor likely falls into Stage III or IV. However, since there is no clear evidence of distant metastasis mentioned in the report, we can conclude that it is more likely to be Stage III due to the size and local invasion characteristics.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
42,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key findings:

1. **Tumor Size and Extent**: The report indicates that the tumor is a moderately differentiated invasive squamous cell carcinoma located in the right tongue, measuring 5.0 cm in greatest dimension. It has invaded the deep tongue muscles but does not invade the mandible.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report states that multiple lymph nodes were excised from the right neck (levels 1B, 2, and 3), and all were negative for malignancy (0/13 lymph nodes involved). This indicates that there is no regional lymph node involvement.

3. **Margins**: The report mentions that all surgical margins are negative for malignancy, which is a positive finding.

4. **AJCC Staging**: According to the AJCC staging system for oral cavity cancers:
   - **Stage I**: Tumor ≤ 2 cm, no lymph node involvement.
   - **Stage II**: Tumor > 2 cm but ≤ 4 cm, no lymph node involvement.
   - **Stage III**: Tumor > 4 cm or any size with lymph node involvement.
   - **Stage IV**: Tumor of any size with extensive local invasion (T4) or any lymph node involvement.

Given that the tumor is 5.0 cm (which is greater than 4 cm) and has invaded the deep tongue muscles (T4a), but there is no lymph node involvement (N0), the report concludes with AJCC pathologic Stage IVA (pT4a, pN0).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IV""}"
43,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer based on the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key findings related to the tumor and lymph nodes.

1. **Tumor Characteristics**:
   - The diagnosis indicates ""invasive squamous carcinoma"" that is moderately differentiated.
   - The tumor size is 3.4 cm in its largest dimension.
   - There is evidence of invasion with a depth of 1.4 cm.
   - The tumor has an infiltrative border and shows perineural invasion, which is significant.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**:
   - The report indicates that multiple levels of lymph nodes (I, II, III, IV) were examined, and all were negative for tumor involvement (0/6, 0/10, 0/18, 0/9).
   - This suggests that there is no regional lymph node metastasis.

3. **AJCC Staging Criteria**:
   - According to AJCC staging for oral cavity cancers:
     - **Stage I**: Tumor ≤ 2 cm, no lymph node involvement.
     - **Stage II**: Tumor > 2 cm but ≤ 4 cm, no lymph node involvement.
     - **Stage III**: Tumor > 4 cm or any size with lymph node involvement.
     - **Stage IV**: Any size with extensive local invasion or distant metastasis.

4. **Applying the Findings**:
   - The tumor size of 3.4 cm fits the criteria for Stage II (tumor > 2 cm but ≤ 4 cm).
   - There is no lymph node involvement, which is consistent with Stage II criteria.

Based on the analysis, the cancer is classified as Stage II due to the tumor size and absence of lymph node metastasis.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
44,"To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the provided pathology report, we need to analyze the key findings related to the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and any distant metastasis.

1. **Tumor Size and Local Invasion**: The report indicates that the invasive squamous cell carcinoma is 3.0 cm in greatest dimension and involves the bilateral inferior epiglottis, extending through the epiglottis into the pre-epiglottic space. This suggests a significant local invasion.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report states that all examined lymph nodes (19 from the left, 5 from the right, and 11 from the supraglottic larynx) are negative for malignancy. This means there is no regional lymph node involvement (N0).

3. **Distant Metastasis**: The report does not indicate any distant metastasis (M0).

Based on the AJCC staging system for laryngeal cancer:
- **Stage I**: Tumor ≤ 2 cm, no lymph node involvement, no metastasis.
- **Stage II**: Tumor > 2 cm but ≤ 4 cm, no lymph node involvement, no metastasis.
- **Stage III**: Tumor > 4 cm or any size with local invasion and no lymph node involvement.
- **Stage IV**: Any size with lymph node involvement or distant metastasis.

Given that the tumor is 3.0 cm (which is > 2 cm but ≤ 4 cm) and there is no lymph node involvement (N0), the appropriate stage according to the AJCC criteria is Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
