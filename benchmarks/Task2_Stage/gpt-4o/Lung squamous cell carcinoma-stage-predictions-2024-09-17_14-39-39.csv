The pathology report provides the following key information:

1. **Tumor Size and Invasion**: The primary tumor is 6.3 cm in diameter and invades the visceral pleura and parietal pericardium, but not the chest wall or mediastinum. This corresponds to a T3 classification.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: Metastatic carcinoma is present in 3 out of 10 regional lymph nodes, specifically in the Level 11 lymph node. This indicates N1 classification, as it involves ipsilateral peribronchial and/or hilar lymph nodes and intrapulmonary nodes.

3. **Distant Metastasis**: The report does not provide evidence of distant metastasis (M0), but it is marked as pMX, indicating that distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

According to the AJCC 6th Edition staging system for lung cancer:
- T3 N1 M0 corresponds to Stage IIIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
1,"## Answer
The pathology report provides several key pieces of information that are relevant to staging the cancer according to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) guidelines:

1. **Tumor Size and Invasion**: The report describes a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with a size of 1.1 cm. It is noted to be invasive of the overlying pleura, which suggests a T2 classification due to pleural invasion (T1 would typically be for tumors â‰¤3 cm without invasion).

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report mentions a benign intrapulmonary lymph node that is negative for carcinoma, indicating no regional lymph node metastasis (N0).

3. **Distant Metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, and the resected rib is negative for carcinoma, suggesting M0.

Based on the AJCC staging system for lung cancer:
- T2 (tumor >3 cm or with pleural invasion)
- N0 (no regional lymph node involvement)
- M0 (no distant metastasis)

This combination of T2, N0, M0 corresponds to Stage IB in the AJCC 8th edition for lung cancer. However, since the options provided are generic stages, we must choose the closest match.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
2,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information:

1. **Tumor Size and Location**: The tumor is a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma measuring 27 mm in maximal dimension, located in the right upper lobe. It is subpleural but does not show definite pleural invasion.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: There is a deposit of poorly differentiated carcinoma present within the hilar lymph node cortex, indicating lymph node metastasis.

3. **Invasion**: There is blood vessel and perineural invasion, but no lymphatic permeation is seen. The tumor is clear of the bronchial resection margin.

4. **Staging Information**: The report provides a staging of T1N1MX. 

   - **T1**: Tumor is 3 cm or less in greatest dimension.
   - **N1**: Metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes and intrapulmonary nodes, including involvement by direct extension.
   - **MX**: Distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Based on the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for lung cancer:

- **Stage I**: T1 or T2, N0, M0
- **Stage II**: T1 or T2, N1, M0
- **Stage III**: T3 or T4, N0 or N1, M0 or any T, N2, M0
- **Stage IV**: Any T, any N, M1

Given the T1N1MX classification, the cancer falls under Stage II, as it involves a T1 tumor with N1 lymph node involvement and no distant metastasis assessment (MX).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
3,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information:

1. **Primary Tumor (T):** The report describes a Grade II-III squamous carcinoma of the lung, measuring 4.5 x 3.5 x 2.0 cm, involving the pleura and focally to the inked pleural margin. The tumor does not invade the bronchial or vascular margins, which are negative. The involvement of the pleura suggests at least a T2 classification, but since it extends to the pleural margin, it could be considered T3.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):** All lymph nodes examined (levels 9, 10, 5, and 7) are negative for tumor involvement. This indicates N0 status, meaning no regional lymph node metastasis.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, suggesting M0 status.

Based on the AJCC staging system for lung cancer:
- T3 N0 M0 corresponds to Stage IIB.
- T2 N0 M0 corresponds to Stage IB.

Given the tumor's involvement with the pleura and the pleural margin, it is more consistent with T3. However, since there is no lymph node involvement or distant metastasis, the cancer is not advanced beyond Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
4,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging:

1. **Tumor Size and Extent (T):** The tumor is described as an exophytic invasive squamous cell carcinoma with a size of 3.7 x 2.8 x 2.8 cm. The pathological staging indicates pT2, which corresponds to a tumor size greater than 3 cm but less than or equal to 5 cm, or a tumor that involves the main bronchus without involvement of the carina, or invades visceral pleura, or is associated with atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis that extends to the hilar region but does not involve the entire lung.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N):** The report indicates N1 involvement, which means there is metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial and/or hilar lymph nodes and intrapulmonary nodes, including involvement by direct extension. Specifically, 1 out of 10 peribronchial lymph nodes is positive for metastasis.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** The report states Mx, meaning distant metastasis cannot be assessed. However, there is no evidence provided in the report of distant metastasis.

Based on the AJCC staging system for lung cancer:
- **Stage I** typically involves T1 or T2a tumors with N0 (no lymph node involvement).
- **Stage II** involves T1 or T2 tumors with N1 (ipsilateral peribronchial/hilar lymph node involvement).
- **Stage III** involves more extensive lymph node involvement (N2 or N3) or larger/more invasive tumors (T3 or T4).
- **Stage IV** involves any T, any N, and M1 (distant metastasis).

Given the information:
- The tumor is pT2.
- There is N1 lymph node involvement.
- There is no evidence of distant metastasis (Mx).

Therefore, the cancer is best classified as Stage II according to the AJCC staging system.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
5,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging:

1. **Tumor Size**: The tumor is 2.4 cm in size.
2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: No lymph nodes are involved (0/7).
3. **Metastasis**: pMX indicates that distant metastasis cannot be assessed.
4. **TNM Staging**: The report specifies pT1b, pN0, pMX.

According to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for lung cancer:

- **T2a**: Tumor size is more than 3 cm but 5 cm or less, or the tumor involves the main bronchus without involvement of the carina, invades visceral pleura, or is associated with atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis that extends to the hilar region but does not involve the entire lung.
- **N0**: No regional lymph node metastasis.

Based on the T2a N0 classification, the cancer is classified as Stage IB according to the AJCC 8th edition staging system for lung cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
8,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to consider the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and any distant metastasis.

1. **Tumor Size (T):** The report describes a squamous cell carcinoma forming a subpleural mass measuring 5 x 4.5 x 2.6 cm. According to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer, a tumor greater than 4 cm but 5 cm or less is classified as T2a.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N):** The report states that multiple intrapulmonary peribronchial lymph nodes and multiple mediastinal and N1 lymph nodes are negative for tumor involvement. This indicates N0, meaning no regional lymph node metastasis.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so we assume M0.

Based on the above information:
- T2a (tumor size > 4 cm but â‰¤ 5 cm)
- N0 (no regional lymph node involvement)
- M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC 8th Edition staging system for lung cancer, a T2aN0M0 classification corresponds to Stage IB.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
9,"## Answer
The pathology report indicates the following key findings:

1. The primary tumor is a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma located in the left upper lobe of the lung, with a greatest diameter of 3.2 cm. The tumor involves the visceral pleura but does not show vascular or perineural invasion. The bronchial margin is free of tumor.

2. The lymph node status is reported as benign for all examined nodes, with no metastatic nodes identified (0/8 peribronchial nodes, and other mediastinal nodes are also benign).

3. There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report.

Based on the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC):

- T2a: Tumor size is greater than 3 cm but 5 cm or less, and it involves the visceral pleura.
- N0: No regional lymph node metastasis.
- M0: No distant metastasis.

The combination of T2a, N0, and M0 corresponds to Stage IB in the AJCC staging system for NSCLC.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
10,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information:

1. **Primary Tumor (pT):** The tumor is classified as pT1b, which indicates a tumor size greater than 1 cm but 3 cm or less in greatest dimension, without invasion of the pleura or main bronchus.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN):** The lymph nodes are classified as pN0, meaning there is no regional lymph node metastasis. The report specifically mentions that the hilar and peribronchial lymph nodes, as well as other submitted lymph nodes, are negative for tumor involvement.

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM):** The report states ""not applicable"" for distant metastasis, which typically implies that there is no evidence of distant metastasis (pM0).

Based on the AJCC staging system for lung cancer:
- Stage I is characterized by a small tumor (T1) with no lymph node involvement (N0) and no distant metastasis (M0).
- Stage II involves larger tumors or limited lymph node involvement.
- Stage III involves more extensive lymph node involvement or larger tumors with local invasion.
- Stage IV involves distant metastasis.

Given the tumor size (pT1b), absence of lymph node involvement (pN0), and no distant metastasis (pM0), the cancer is classified as Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
11,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging the cancer:

1. **T Stage (Tumor size and extent):** The report indicates a T4 stage. This is due to the presence of two foci of moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, with the largest tumor being 4.5 cm and associated with visceral pleural and angiolymphatic invasion. T4 indicates a tumor of any size that invades the mediastinum, heart, great vessels, trachea, esophagus, vertebral body, or carina, or separate tumor nodule(s) in a different ipsilateral lobe.

2. **N Stage (Lymph node involvement):** The report indicates N1 stage, as metastatic squamous cell carcinoma is present in one of twelve N1 lymph nodes. N1 indicates metastasis in ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes and intrapulmonary nodes, including involvement by direct extension.

3. **M Stage (Distant metastasis):** The report indicates Mx, meaning that the presence of distant metastasis cannot be assessed. However, the T4 classification and N1 involvement are sufficient to determine the stage without confirmed distant metastasis.

According to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for non-small cell lung cancer, a T4N1Mx classification corresponds to Stage III cancer. Stage III is characterized by larger tumors that may have invaded nearby structures and/or have spread to nearby lymph nodes but not to distant sites.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"

24,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the lung cancer from the pathology report, we need to consider the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and any distant metastasis.

1. **Tumor Size**: The tumor is 3 x 2 x 2 cm. According to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer, a tumor size of 3 cm falls into the T1 category (specifically T1b, which is for tumors more than 2 cm but 3 cm or less).

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report indicates that 3 out of 6 lymph nodes are positive for metastasis. This suggests N1 involvement, which is defined as metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes and intrapulmonary nodes, including involvement by direct extension.

3. **Distant Metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so we assume M0 (no distant metastasis).

Based on these findings:
- T1b (tumor size)
- N1 (lymph node involvement)
- M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system for lung cancer, a T1bN1M0 classification corresponds to Stage IIA.

The provided text does not contain specific information about tumor size, lymph node involvement, or metastasis, which are critical components for determining the AJCC stage of cancer. The text appears to be instructions for completing a pathology report form rather than an actual pathology report with diagnostic details. Without specific details such as T (tumor size), N (lymph node involvement), and M (metastasis) classifications, it is impossible to accurately determine the cancer stage.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Not Determinable""}"
27,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging:

1. **Tumor Size and Characteristics**: The tumor is 7.7 cm in greatest dimension, which places it in the T2 category according to the AJCC staging system. The tumor also invades the visceral pleura, which is consistent with T2.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report states ""pN0: No regional lymph node metastasis,"" indicating that there is no lymph node involvement.

3. **Distant Metastasis**: The report mentions ""pMX: Cannot be assessed,"" which means distant metastasis cannot be evaluated from this report.

Based on the AJCC staging criteria for lung cancer:
- T2 indicates a tumor greater than 3 cm but less than or equal to 7 cm, or a tumor with certain features such as invasion of the visceral pleura.
- N0 indicates no regional lymph node metastasis.
- M0 would be assumed in the absence of evidence of distant metastasis, but since pMX is stated, we consider the absence of known metastasis.

Given these factors, the cancer would be classified as Stage II, as Stage II typically involves T2 tumors with N0 and M0 status.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
28,"## Answer
The pathology report describes a Grade 4 squamous cell carcinoma in the left upper lobe of the lung, forming a 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm mass. The tumor is located 1.8 cm away from the bronchial margin, which is negative for tumor involvement. Additionally, multiple intrapulmonary peribronchial lymph nodes and the visceral pleura are negative for tumor involvement. The report also mentions that multiple lymph nodes from various regions (superior mediastinal, aortic, inferior mediastinal, left lower lobe bronchus) are negative for tumor.

According to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer, Stage I is characterized by a tumor that is 3 cm or less in greatest dimension, without involvement of lymph nodes or distant metastasis. The tumor described in the report is 2.0 cm in size, and there is no lymph node involvement or distant metastasis mentioned. Therefore, based on the information provided, the cancer is consistent with Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
29,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging:

1. **Tumor Size and Invasion**: The primary tumor is 4.5 cm in greatest dimension and invades the visceral pleura but not the pericardium. This corresponds to a T2 classification in the TNM staging system.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: No tumor is seen in any of the examined lymph nodes (0/7), which corresponds to N0.

3. **Metastasis**: The report indicates pMX, meaning distant metastasis cannot be assessed, but there is no evidence provided of distant metastasis.

Based on the TNM classification:
- T2: Tumor size >3 cm but â‰¤5 cm or tumor involves the visceral pleura.
- N0: No regional lymph node metastasis.
- M0 (assumed as no evidence of metastasis is provided): No distant metastasis.

According to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for lung cancer:
- T2 N0 M0 corresponds to Stage IB.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
30,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to consider the primary tumor size and characteristics (T), regional lymph node involvement (N), and distant metastasis (M).

1. **Primary Tumor (T):** 
   - The pathology report describes two lesions in the right upper lobe, measuring 2.6 cm and 4 cm. The 2.6 cm lesion has visceral pleural invasion, while the larger lesion extends peripherally but without definite visceral pleural invasion. 
   - The report classifies these as pT3 due to the presence of two nodules of similar histology in the same lobe.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):**
   - The report indicates pN1, with metastatic carcinoma found in one of three hilar lymph nodes. The other lymph nodes (level 11, 2R, 4R, and level 7) are negative for malignancy.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):**
   - The report states pMX, meaning distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Based on the AJCC staging system:
- **Stage I** typically involves T1 or T2 tumors with no lymph node involvement (N0) and no distant metastasis (M0).
- **Stage II** involves T1 or T2 tumors with N1 lymph node involvement and no distant metastasis (M0).
- **Stage III** involves T3 or T4 tumors and/or N2 or N3 lymph node involvement, with no distant metastasis (M0).
- **Stage IV** involves any T, any N, and M1 (distant metastasis present).

Given the classification of pT3, pN1, and pMX, the cancer is consistent with Stage III, as it involves a T3 tumor with N1 lymph node involvement.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
31,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to consider several factors from the pathology report, including tumor size, lymph node involvement, and metastasis. The provided pathology report includes the following relevant details:

1. **Tumor Size**: The tumor measures 3 x 2.5 x 2 cm. According to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer, a tumor size of 3 cm or less is typically classified as T1, while a tumor size greater than 3 cm but 5 cm or less is classified as T2.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report does not specify any lymph node involvement. In the absence of lymph node involvement, we assume N0.

3. **Distant Metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so we assume M0.

Based on the information provided:
- Tumor size suggests T2 (since it is greater than 3 cm but less than 5 cm).
- No lymph node involvement suggests N0.
- No distant metastasis suggests M0.

Combining these, the TNM classification would be T2N0M0. According to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer, T2N0M0 corresponds to Stage IIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
32,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging:

1. **Tumor Size and Characteristics**: The tumor is 4.0 cm in greatest dimension, which corresponds to a T2 classification. There is no pleural invasion, and the bronchial resection margin is negative for the tumor. Venous invasion is present.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: One lobar lymph node out of nine is positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma. This corresponds to N1 classification, indicating metastasis in ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes.

3. **Distant Metastasis**: The report states pMX, meaning distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Based on the AJCC staging system for lung cancer:
- **T2** indicates a tumor greater than 3 cm but less than or equal to 5 cm, or a tumor with certain features such as invasion into the main bronchus.
- **N1** indicates metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes.
- **M0** would be assumed in the absence of evidence of distant metastasis, but since pMX is given, we cannot definitively say M0.

Combining T2 and N1, the cancer is classified as Stage II according to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
33,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging:

1. **Primary Tumor (pT):** The tumor is classified as pT2a, which indicates a tumor greater than 3 cm but less than 5 cm in greatest dimension, surrounded by lung or visceral pleura, without invasion into the main bronchus or other specified criteria.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN):** The classification is pN0, meaning there is no regional lymph node metastasis. All examined lymph nodes are negative for malignancy.

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM):** Not applicable, which typically means there is no evidence of distant metastasis.

According to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for lung cancer:

- **Stage I:** Typically involves a tumor that is limited in size and has not spread to lymph nodes or distant sites. Specifically, Stage IA includes pT1a-c, N0, M0, and Stage IB includes pT2a, N0, M0.
- **Stage II:** Involves larger tumors or those with limited lymph node involvement but no distant metastasis.
- **Stage III:** Involves more extensive lymph node involvement or larger tumors with certain local extensions.
- **Stage IV:** Involves distant metastasis.

Given the tumor size (pT2a) and the absence of lymph node involvement (pN0) and distant metastasis, the cancer fits the criteria for Stage IB.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
34,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information:

1. **Primary Tumor (pT):** The tumor measures 5.5 cm and extends through the pleura but is not identified at the outer surface of the specimen. This suggests a T2 or T3 classification, depending on the specific criteria for pleural involvement.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN):** pN0, indicating no regional lymph node metastasis.

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM):** pMx, meaning distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Given the tumor size and pleural involvement, the primary tumor could be classified as T2b (tumor >5 cm but â‰¤7 cm) or T3 (if the pleural involvement is significant enough to classify it as such). However, since the tumor is not identified at the outer surface, it is more likely T2b.

The absence of lymph node involvement (pN0) and the inability to assess distant metastasis (pMx) suggest that the cancer has not spread beyond the primary site and regional nodes.

According to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer:
- **Stage I** typically involves T1 or T2a tumors with N0 and M0.
- **Stage II** involves T2b or T3 tumors with N0 and M0.
- **Stage III** involves any T with N1 or N2, or T3 with N0.
- **Stage IV** involves any T, any N, with M1.

Given the information, the most appropriate classification is Stage II, as the tumor is T2b with N0 and Mx.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
35,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging:

1. **Tumor Size and Invasion (T):** The tumor is described as a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma measuring 4.9 x 4.7 x 4.5 cm. It invades through the visceral and parietal pleura into the chest wall skeletal muscle and into rib bone. This corresponds to a T3 classification, as it involves invasion into the chest wall.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N):** The report indicates that multiple lymph nodes (R4, Level 7, L4, R2, Level 10, Level 11) were biopsied and all were negative for malignancy. This corresponds to an N0 classification, indicating no regional lymph node metastasis.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, which implies M0.

4. **Pleural Invasion (PL):** The report mentions carcinoma invades through visceral and parietal pleura into the chest wall, which is noted as PL3.

Based on the TNM classification provided in the report (pT3 pN0 PL3), the cancer is staged as Stage IIB according to the AJCC 8th edition for lung cancer. However, the options provided do not include Stage IIB specifically, but Stage III is the closest match considering the extent of local invasion.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
36,"## Answer
The pathology report provides several key pieces of information that are crucial for determining the AJCC stage of the lung cancer:

1. **Tumor Size and Location**: The primary tumor is described as a 4.5 x 4 x 3 cm mass located in the left upper lobe of the lung. It is invasive and extends close to the bronchial margin, but does not invade the pleura.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: There is significant lymph node involvement:
   - 6 out of 14 intrapulmonary peribronchial lymph nodes are involved.
   - Metastasis is present in 2 out of 2 aortopulmonary and 1 out of 2 anterior mediastinal lymph nodes.
   - Other lymph nodes (superior mediastinal, inferior mediastinal, and fissure) are negative for tumor.

3. **Distant Metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report.

Based on the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for lung cancer:
- **T (Tumor)**: The tumor is larger than 4 cm but does not invade the pleura or other structures, which suggests a T2 classification.
- **N (Nodes)**: There is involvement of multiple lymph nodes, including mediastinal nodes, which suggests at least N2 classification.
- **M (Metastasis)**: There is no evidence of distant metastasis, so M0.

Combining these, the cancer is likely at least Stage III due to the N2 lymph node involvement. Stage III is characterized by the spread to lymph nodes in the mediastinum or other areas that are not on the same side as the primary tumor.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
37,"## Answer
The pathology report describes a poorly differentiated large cell carcinoma with squamoid features in the right lower lobe of the lung. The tumor is 3.5 cm in greatest dimension and shows pulmonary parenchymal invasion. Importantly, the closest inked pleural margin is negative for malignancy, and there is no lymphovascular invasion. Additionally, all lymph nodes examined (anterior lobular, subcarinal, right hilum, right lower peritracheal) are benign, indicating no lymph node involvement. 

According to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer:
- Stage I: Tumor â‰¤4 cm, no lymph node involvement, no distant metastasis.
- Stage II: Tumor >4 cm or involvement of nearby structures, but no distant metastasis.
- Stage III: Involvement of lymph nodes or nearby structures.
- Stage IV: Distant metastasis.

Given that the tumor is 3.5 cm, there is no lymph node involvement, and no distant metastasis, the cancer fits the criteria for Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
38,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information:

1. **Tumor Size and Location**: The tumor is located in the right lower lobe of the lung and measures 2.9 x 2.5 x 1.8 cm. It is described as moderately to poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. The tumor extends subpleurally but not to the pleural surface, and there is no vascular or perineural invasion. The bronchial margin is free of tumor.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report indicates that multiple lymph nodes were examined (Level VII mediastinal and Level XI mediastinal), and all were benign (0/1, 0/1, 0/3), meaning there is no lymph node involvement.

3. **Metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report.

Based on the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for lung cancer:

- **T (Tumor size and extent)**: The tumor is less than 3 cm and does not invade the main bronchus or visceral pleura, which corresponds to T1.
- **N (Regional lymph nodes)**: No regional lymph node metastasis is found, which corresponds to N0.
- **M (Distant metastasis)**: There is no evidence of distant metastasis, which corresponds to M0.

Combining these, the cancer is classified as T1N0M0, which corresponds to Stage I according to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
39,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging:

1. **Tumor Size and Extent (T):** The tumor is described as being 8.5 cm in size, located in the right lower lobe, and extending up to the pleura. The TNM classification given is pT2. According to the AJCC staging system, a pT2 tumor is one that is more than 3 cm but 5 cm or less in greatest dimension, or involves the main bronchus, invades visceral pleura, or is associated with atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis that extends to the hilar region but does not involve the entire lung.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N):** The report states pN0, indicating no regional lymph node metastasis. This means that the cancer has not spread to nearby lymph nodes.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** The report states pMX, meaning that the presence of distant metastasis cannot be assessed. However, there is no mention of distant metastasis in the report.

4. **Resection Margins and Lymph Nodes:** The resection margins and all lymph nodes identified and excised are tumor-free, indicating a complete resection with no residual tumor (R0).

5. **Stage Provided in Report:** The report explicitly states ""stage IB,"" which aligns with the TNM classification provided (pT2 pN0 pMX).

Based on the TNM classification (pT2 pN0 pMX) and the explicit stage provided in the report (stage IB), the cancer is classified as Stage I according to the AJCC staging system.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
40,"## Answer
The pathology report provides detailed information about the tumor and lymph nodes:

1. **Primary Tumor (pT):** The tumor is classified as pT3. This is due to the presence of separate tumor nodules in the same lobe, away from the main central tumor. According to the AJCC staging system, pT3 can include tumors with separate tumor nodules in the same lobe.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN):** The report indicates pN0, meaning there is no regional lymph node metastasis. All examined lymph nodes (8 in total) are negative for metastatic carcinoma.

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM):** The report does not mention any distant metastasis, which implies pM0.

Based on the TNM classification:
- **T3** indicates a more advanced local tumor due to the presence of separate tumor nodules in the same lobe.
- **N0** indicates no regional lymph node involvement.
- **M0** indicates no distant metastasis.

According to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer:
- Stage III typically involves T3 with N1 or N2, or T4 with any N, but not with distant metastasis (M0).
- Stage IV involves any T, any N, with M1 (distant metastasis).

Given the information:
- The tumor is T3, N0, M0, which corresponds to Stage IIB in the AJCC 8th edition for lung cancer staging.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
41,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the lung cancer from the pathology report, we need to consider the following key factors:

1. **Tumor Size**: The tumor size is 6.5 x 5.5 x 5.5 cm. According to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer, a tumor larger than 5 cm but 7 cm or less is classified as T2b.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report states that 0 out of 6 lymph nodes are positive for metastasis. This indicates N0, meaning there is no regional lymph node involvement.

3. **Distant Metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, which suggests M0.

Based on these factors:
- T2b (tumor size >5 cm but â‰¤7 cm)
- N0 (no regional lymph node involvement)
- M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system for lung cancer, a T2b, N0, M0 classification corresponds to Stage IIA.

To determine the AJCC stage of the lung cancer from the pathology report, we need to consider the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and presence of metastasis.

1. **Tumor Size (T):** The report indicates a 3.5 cm invasive, poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma in the left lower lobe of the lung. According to AJCC staging for lung cancer, a tumor size of more than 3 cm but 5 cm or less is classified as T2.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N):** The report states that the level 9L lymph node is negative for metastatic carcinoma (0/1). This means there is no regional lymph node involvement, which corresponds to N0.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so we assume M0.

Based on the TNM classification:
- T2 (tumor size >3 cm but â‰¤5 cm)
- N0 (no regional lymph node involvement)
- M0 (no distant metastasis)

The combination of T2, N0, M0 corresponds to Stage I lung cancer according to the AJCC staging system.

The pathology report provides the following key information:

1. **Tumor Size and Characteristics**: The tumor is a 9.5 cm moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma located in the left upper lobe of the lung. It has paraphrenic extension but no visceral pleural invasion.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: All sampled lymph nodes are benign, indicating no regional lymph node metastasis (N0).

3. **Metastasis**: The report states ""Mx,"" which means distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

4. **Pathologic Stage**: The report explicitly states the pathologic stage as pT3N0Mx.

According to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for lung cancer:

- **T3** indicates a tumor larger than 7 cm or one that invades certain structures (such as the chest wall, diaphragm, etc.), but without visceral pleural invasion.
- **N0** indicates no regional lymph node metastasis.
- **Mx** indicates that distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

For lung cancer, a T3N0Mx classification typically corresponds to Stage IIB. However, since the options provided do not include Stage IIB, we must consider the closest available stage. Given the absence of lymph node involvement and the inability to assess distant metastasis, the cancer is not advanced enough to be considered Stage III or Stage IV. Therefore, the most appropriate stage from the given options is Stage II.

{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
46,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the lung cancer from the pathology report, we need to consider the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and any distant metastasis.

1. **Tumor Size (T):** The report states that the tumor in the right lung is 5.0 cm in greatest diameter. According to AJCC staging, a tumor greater than 4 cm but less than or equal to 5 cm is classified as T2b.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N):** The report indicates metastatic carcinoma in regional lymph nodes, with 6 out of 9 peribronchial lymph nodes and 1 out of 1 parenchymal lymph node showing metastasis. This suggests significant regional lymph node involvement. According to AJCC staging, involvement of ipsilateral peribronchial and/or hilar lymph nodes is classified as N1. However, the presence of direct tumor extension into lymph nodes and the number of nodes involved could suggest N2, which involves ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so we assume M0.

Based on the above information:
- T2b: Tumor size between 4 and 5 cm.
- N2: Significant regional lymph node involvement.
- M0: No distant metastasis.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system for lung cancer, a T2b N2 M0 classification corresponds to Stage IIIA.

The pathology report provides the following key information for staging:

1. **Tumor Size and Extent (T):** The tumor is described as a large-cell squamous cell carcinoma, poorly differentiated, located in the upper lobe of the left lung, with a maximum size of 9 cm. It extends to the visceral pleura but does not infiltrate it. The TNM classification given is pT2, which typically indicates a tumor size greater than 3 cm but less than or equal to 5 cm, or a tumor that involves the main bronchus, visceral pleura, or causes atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N):** The report states pN0, indicating no regional lymph node metastasis. Multiple lymph nodes were examined, and all were found to be tumor-free.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** The report indicates pMX, meaning that distant metastasis cannot be assessed. However, there is no mention of confirmed distant metastasis in the report.

4. **Other Considerations:** The report mentions RX, indicating that the resection margins are uncertain, but the bronchus resection margin is tumor-free. The tumor extends to the visceral pleura but does not infiltrate it, which is significant for staging.

Based on the TNM classification provided (pT2 pN0 pMX) and the description of the tumor, the cancer is classified as Stage IB according to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer. Stage IB typically corresponds to T2a N0 M0, where the tumor is larger than 3 cm but 5 cm or less, without lymph node involvement or distant metastasis.

The pathology report provides the following key information for staging:

1. **Tumor Type and Size**: The tumor is a squamous cell carcinoma measuring 1.8 cm.
2. **Histologic Grade**: Poorly differentiated.
3. **Surgical Margins**: All surgical margins are free of tumor.
4. **Direct Extension of Tumor**: Not identified.
5. **Lymphatic and Venous Invasion**: Both are absent.
6. **Lymph Nodes**: 6 lymph nodes were examined, and none were involved (0/6).
7. **TNM Staging**: pT1a, pN0, pMX.

Based on the TNM staging:
- **T1a** indicates a tumor size of 2 cm or less.
- **N0** indicates no regional lymph node metastasis.
- **MX** indicates that distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

According to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for lung cancer:
- **Stage I** is characterized by T1a or T1b, N0, M0.

Given that the tumor is T1a, N0, and there is no evidence of distant metastasis (though MX is noted, typically M0 is assumed in the absence of evidence), this corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
49,"## Answer
The pathology report describes a poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinoma of the lung with both squamous and high-grade spindle cell features. The carcinoma involves the pleural surface, but all other surgical margins are negative for tumor. Additionally, the report mentions that one hilar lymph node and lymph nodes from stations 5 and 11 are negative for tumor involvement.

To determine the AJCC stage, we need to consider the TNM classification:
- **T (Tumor size and extent):** The involvement of the pleural surface suggests at least a T2 classification, as T2 includes tumors that invade the visceral pleura.
- **N (Regional lymph nodes):** The lymph nodes examined (hilar, station 5, and station 11) are negative for tumor, indicating N0.
- **M (Distant metastasis):** There is no mention of distant metastasis, suggesting M0.

Based on the TNM classification:
- T2, N0, M0 corresponds to Stage IB in the AJCC 8th edition for non-small cell lung cancer.

Therefore, the answer is -

50,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information:

1. **Tumor Size and Location**: The tumor is 37 mm in maximal dimension, located in the left upper lobe of the lung. It is described as a poorly-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma.

2. **Invasion and Margins**: There is no pleural invasion, blood vessel invasion, lymphatic permeation, or perineural permeation. The tumor is well clear of the bronchial resection margin.

3. **Lymph Nodes**: No lymph node metastases are identified. The peribronchial lymph nodes show sinus histiocytosis and carbon pigment but no evidence of tumor.

4. **Pathological Stage**: The report provides a pathological stage of T2N0Mx.

- **T2** indicates a tumor size greater than 3 cm but 5 cm or less, or a tumor that involves the main bronchus, invades visceral pleura, or is associated with atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis that extends to the hilar region but does not involve the entire lung.
- **N0** indicates no regional lymph node metastasis.
- **Mx** indicates that distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Based on the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for lung cancer:

- **Stage I**: T1-2, N0, M0
- **Stage II**: T2-3, N0-1, M0
- **Stage III**: T1-3, N1-2, M0 or T4, N0-2, M0
- **Stage IV**: Any T, Any N, M1

Given the information, the tumor is classified as T2N0Mx, which corresponds to Stage I when considering the absence of lymph node involvement (N0) and no evidence of distant metastasis (Mx, but typically considered M0 for staging purposes unless proven otherwise).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
51,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of lung cancer, we typically need information on the tumor size (T), lymph node involvement (N), and presence of metastasis (M). This is known as the TNM staging system.

1. **Tumor Size (T):** The tumor size is given as 4 x 3 x 3.5 cm. According to the AJCC 8th edition for lung cancer, a tumor size of more than 3 cm but 5 cm or less is classified as T2.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N):** The report does not specify any lymph node involvement. In the absence of lymph node information, we assume N0, meaning no regional lymph node metastasis.

3. **Metastasis (M):** There is no information provided about distant metastasis. In the absence of such information, we assume M0, meaning no distant metastasis.

Based on the above assumptions:
- T2 (tumor size >3 cm but â‰¤5 cm)
- N0 (no lymph node involvement)
- M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging for lung cancer, a T2N0M0 classification corresponds to Stage IIA.

However, since the options provided are only Stage I, Stage II, Stage III, and Stage IV, and given the lack of specific lymph node or metastasis information, the most appropriate choice based on the tumor size alone would be Stage II.

The pathology report provides the following key information:

1. **Tumor Size and Location**: The primary tumor is a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma measuring 28 mm in maximal dimension, located in the right upper lobe. This corresponds to a T2 classification, as the tumor is greater than 3 cm but less than 5 cm in greatest dimension.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report mentions that the tumor appears to directly invade a peribronchial lymph node, which indicates N1 classification. However, other lymph nodes (right middle lobe, right upper lobe, No. 7, No. 8, No. 9, azygous, and right main bronchus) show reactive changes only, with no evidence of malignancy, except for one lymph node presumed to contain a deposit of squamous cell carcinoma.

3. **Metastasis**: The report does not provide evidence of distant metastasis (M0), but it mentions MX, indicating that distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

4. **Additional Findings**: There is probable pleural invasion, but no blood vessel, lymphatic, or perineural invasion is present. The squamous cell carcinoma in situ extends to the bronchial margin, but the invasive component is clear.

Based on the AJCC staging system:
- T2 indicates a tumor size greater than 3 cm but less than 5 cm.
- N1 indicates metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial and/or hilar lymph nodes and intrapulmonary nodes, including involvement by direct extension.
- MX indicates that distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Combining these, the cancer is classified as T2N1MX, which corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"

The pathology report provides the following key information for staging the lung cancer according to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) guidelines:

1. **Tumor Size and Extent (T):** The tumor is described as a 4 cm invasive squamous cell carcinoma located in the right lower lobe of the lung. It does not involve the visceral pleura, and there is no lymphovascular space invasion. The tumor size of 4 cm classifies it as T2 (since T1 is for tumors â‰¤3 cm).

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):** The report indicates that there is no evidence of metastatic carcinoma in any of the examined lymph nodes (0/1 in level 9, 0/4 in level 11, 0/11 in peribronchial, 0/1 in level 4, and multiple matted nodes in level 7). This means there is no regional lymph node metastasis, classifying it as N0.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** The report states ""Mx,"" indicating that the presence of distant metastasis cannot be assessed from the information provided.

Based on the TNM classification:
- T2: Tumor size >3 cm but â‰¤5 cm, or tumor involves main bronchus or invades visceral pleura.
- N0: No regional lymph node metastasis.
- Mx: Distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

According to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer:
- Stage I: T1-2, N0, M0
- Stage II: T1-2, N1, M0 or T2, N0, M0
- Stage III: T1-2, N2, M0 or T3, any N, M0
- Stage IV: Any T, any N, M1

Given the classification of T2N0Mx, the cancer is classified as Stage IIA, which falls under Stage II in the options provided.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
54,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging:

1. **Primary Tumor (T):** The tumor is 5.6 cm in greatest dimension and involves the main bronchus, which classifies it as pT2b. According to the AJCC 8th edition, a tumor greater than 5 cm but less than or equal to 7 cm, or a tumor that involves the main bronchus without involvement of the carina, is classified as T2b.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):** All examined lymph nodes are negative for malignancy (0/4 peribronchial lymph nodes and several other levels), which classifies it as pN0.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** Distant metastasis was not evaluated (pMX), but there is no indication of distant metastasis in the report.

Based on the TNM classification:
- T2b
- N0
- M0 (assumed, as no metastasis is mentioned)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system for lung cancer:
- T2b N0 M0 corresponds to Stage IIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
55,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging the cancer according to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) system:

1. **T Stage (Tumor size and extent):** The report indicates a pT2a stage. This means the primary tumor is more than 3 cm but 5 cm or less in greatest dimension, or it involves the main bronchus without involvement of the carina, invades visceral pleura, or is associated with atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis that extends to the hilar region but does not involve the entire lung.

2. **N Stage (Regional lymph nodes):** The report indicates pN0, which means there is no regional lymph node metastasis. All examined lymph nodes (N1 and N2) are free of carcinoma.

3. **M Stage (Distant metastasis):** The report states ""M stage, pathologic: Not applicable,"" which implies there is no evidence of distant metastasis (M0).

Based on the TNM classification provided:
- T2a
- N0
- M0

This combination corresponds to Stage IB according to the AJCC 7th Edition staging system for lung cancer. However, since the options provided do not include Stage IB, the closest match is Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
56,"## Answer
The pathology report provides detailed information about the tumor and its classification. Let's break down the key points:

1. **Tumor Type and Grade**: The tumor is identified as a squamous cell carcinoma, moderately differentiated (G2).

2. **Tumor Size and Location**: The largest tumor mass is 3.0 x 3.0 x 3.0 cm, located in the right lower lobe of the lung.

3. **Lymph Node Involvement**: Two lymph nodes were examined, and neither contained metastatic carcinoma (0/2).

4. **Visceral Pleural Invasion**: Not identified.

5. **Lymphovascular Invasion**: Findings are suspicious but not confirmed.

6. **Tumor Extension**: Appears confined to the lung.

7. **pTN Stage**: Initially classified as pT1bN0, but revised to pT3N0 due to the presence of a satellite tumor.

8. **Revised Classification**: The presence of a satellite tumor classifies the neoplasm as T3, which is crucial for staging.

According to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for lung cancer, a T3 classification indicates a more advanced local tumor, often involving additional structures or multiple tumor nodules in the same lobe. However, since there is no lymph node involvement (N0) and no distant metastasis (M0), the cancer is classified as Stage IIB.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
