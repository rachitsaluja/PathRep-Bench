Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (pT)**: The report mentions two separate primary tumors, one in the lingula (1 cm) and another in the left lower lobe (3.5 cm). Both tumors are adenocarcinomas with different histological subtypes. The larger tumor (3.5 cm) is classified as pT2a, as it is greater than 3 cm but not more than 5 cm in greatest dimension.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN)**: The report states that four lymph nodes were negative for carcinoma (0/4), indicating that there is no regional lymph node metastasis. Therefore, pN is classified as pN0.

3. **Distant Metastases (pM)**: There is no mention of distant metastases in the report, so pM is classified as pM0.

Considering the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* pT2a (primary tumor size > 3 cm but ≤ 5 cm)
* pN0 (no regional lymph node metastasis)
* pM0 (no distant metastases)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, the stage corresponding to pT2a, pN0, and pM0 is **Stage II**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
1,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor is located in the right lower lobe of the lung, and its size is 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.6 cm, which corresponds to a T2 tumor (tumor size > 2 cm but ≤ 5 cm).
2. The tumor invades the pleura, but there is no lymphovascular space invasion.
3. The surgical margin status shows that the tumor is at least 2.8 cm away from the bronchial margin and focally involves the pleural surface.
4. The lymph node status is N0, as all lymph nodes (stations 4, 7, 11, and 12) are negative for tumor.

Based on these findings, the TNM classification is T2N0. According to the AJCC staging system, a T2N0 tumor corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
2,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Primary tumor (pT): The report states that the tumor size is 2.8 cm (greatest dimension), and it is classified as pT1b, which corresponds to a tumor larger than 2 cm but not more than 3 cm in greatest dimension.

2. Regional lymph nodes (pN): The report indicates that 1 out of 17 lymph nodes are involved (pN1). Specifically, 1 lymph node in the peribronchial region of the left lower lobe is positive for malignancy.

3. Distant metastasis (pM): The report states that the distant metastasis status is pMX, which means it cannot be assessed.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* The primary tumor is classified as pT1b, which corresponds to a T1 tumor.
* The regional lymph nodes are classified as pN1, which corresponds to an N1 tumor.
* There is no evidence of distant metastasis.

According to the AJCC staging system, a T1 tumor with N1 nodes corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
3,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The tumor size is 2.5 x 2.0 cm, which corresponds to pT1 (tumor size ≤ 3 cm).
* Ten out of twelve lymph nodes are involved by metastatic carcinoma, including the subcarinal lymph node, which indicates pN2 (metastasis in 4-6 lymph nodes).
* There is no distant metastasis (pMX).

According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor with pT1 and pN2 corresponds to Stage IIIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IIIA}"
4,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Primary tumor (pT): The report states that the tumor measures 2.7 cm in greatest dimension and invades the visceral pleura, which corresponds to pT2a.
2. Regional lymph nodes (pN): The report states that two lymph nodes were examined, and none were involved, which corresponds to pN0.
3. Distant metastasis (pM): There is no mention of distant metastasis, so pM0 is assumed.

According to the AJCC 7th edition staging system, a tumor with pT2a, pN0, and pM0 corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
5,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (pT)**: The tumor size is 2.5 cm, which falls under pT1b (Tumor greater than 2 cm, but 3 cm or less in greatest dimension, surrounded by lung or visceral pleura, without bronchoscopic evidence of invasion more proximal than the lobar bronchus).
2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN)**: There is no regional lymph node metastasis, so pN0.
3. **Distant Metastases (pM)**: Not applicable, as there is no evidence of distant metastases.

Based on the above information, the AJCC stage is determined by the pT and pN categories. In this case, pT1b and pN0 correspond to **Stage I**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage I}"
6,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the right lower lobe lung and measures 5 x 4 x 3 cm, which corresponds to a T2 tumor (since it's larger than 3 cm but not more than 5 cm).
2. The bronchial margin is negative for tumor, which indicates that the tumor has not invaded the bronchus.
3. One of the six intrapulmonary peribronchial lymph nodes is positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma, which indicates N1 disease (metastasis to intrapulmonary lymph nodes).
4. The report does not mention any distant metastases (M1 disease).

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* T2 (primary tumor size)
* N1 (metastasis to intrapulmonary lymph nodes)
* M0 (no distant metastases)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2N1M0 tumor corresponds to Stage IIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IIA}"
7,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor size is 2.3 cm in greatest diameter, which corresponds to a T1b tumor (T1b: tumor 2 cm or less in greatest dimension, but more than 1 cm).
2. The tumor does not invade the visceral pleura, but extends up to it (Visceral pleural invasion: Carcinoma extends up to but not through visceral pleura).
3. There is no evidence of lymph node metastasis (pN0) in the level 7, 9, and 4 lymph nodes.
4. The surgical margin status is carcinoma extends to within 1 mm of the staple line on this wedge resection, but there is no evidence of residual carcinoma in the lobectomy specimen.

Based on these findings, the pTN stage is pT1b NO, which corresponds to Stage I according to the AJCC staging system.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
8,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the right upper lobe, and its size is 3.5 x 2.4 x 2.3 cm. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a tumor of this size corresponds to T2a (tumor >2 cm but ≤3 cm in greatest dimension).
2. The tumor does not grossly appear to involve the bronchus, but it is close to the bronchial margin (0.3 cm). This suggests that the tumor does not invade the bronchus, which is supported by the negative bronchial margin.
3. There is no pleural invasion, and the tumor is 0.2 cm away from the pleura.
4. There are two small pleural nodules, one 0.4 cm in diameter and 5.2 cm from the main tumor mass, and another 0.4 cm in diameter and 3.1 cm from the main tumor mass. These nodules are likely satellite tumor nodules, which are considered T3a.
5. One hilar lymph node (R10) is positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma, which corresponds to N1.
6. There is no evidence of distant metastases (M0).

Considering the above findings, the AJCC stage of the cancer is:

T2a (primary tumor size) + N1 (metastasis to hilar lymph node) + M0 (no distant metastases) = Stage IIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IIA}"
9,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions a left lower lobectomy with a tumor measuring 50 x 60 x 45 mm, which is a significant size. This suggests a T2 tumor, as it is larger than 3 cm but not more than 5 cm.
2. The tumor appears to abut the lateral and diaphragmatic pleural surfaces, but no definite invasion of the pleura is seen. The addendum report confirms that no pleural invasion is seen with special stains. This rules out a T3 or T4 tumor.
3. The report mentions that the tumor surrounds a major segmental bronchus and extends close to the bronchial resection margin, but the bronchial resection margin is free of tumor. This suggests that the tumor has not invaded the bronchus.
4. There is no evidence of vascular or perineural invasion.
5. Small satellite deposits of tumor are scattered throughout the adjacent parenchyma, but this does not affect the T stage.
6. No metastases to hilar lymph nodes are seen, which means the N stage is N0.
7. There is no mention of distant metastases, so the M stage is Mx (unknown).

Based on the above findings, the TNM stage is T2N0Mx.

According to the AJCC staging system, a T2N0Mx corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
10,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Tumor size**: The tumor size is 3 x 3 x 3 cm, which is a significant factor in determining the T stage. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a tumor of this size corresponds to a T2 stage (tumors > 3 cm in greatest dimension).

2. **Tumor extent**: The tumor extends to the visceral pleura, which indicates a T2 stage as well.

3. **Lymph nodes**: One out of one lymph node is positive for metastasis, which is an N1 stage (metastasis to intrathoracic lymph nodes).

4. **Distant metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so we can assume M0 (no distant metastasis).

Now, let's combine the T, N, and M stages to determine the overall stage. With a T2 stage, N1 stage, and M0 stage, the patient's cancer corresponds to **Stage III** according to the AJCC 8th edition staging system.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
11,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor size is 4.0 X 3.5 X 2.0 cm, which corresponds to a pT2 classification, indicating a tumor larger than 3 cm but not more than 5 cm in greatest dimension.

2. The report states ""pNO (0/20)"", which means there is no lymph node involvement (N0).

3. There is no mention of distant metastases, and the report states ""pMx"", which means the presence or absence of distant metastases cannot be assessed. However, in the absence of any other information, we can assume there are no distant metastases (M0).

4. The tumor has infiltrated the pleura visceralis, but this does not affect the T classification, as it is already classified as pT2.

5. Considering the pT2 classification and the absence of lymph node involvement (N0) and distant metastases (M0), the AJCC stage of the cancer is Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
12,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (T)**: The tumor size is 2.7 cm in diameter, and it does not grossly involve the bronchus. The distance to the bronchial margin is approximately 2.9 cm. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a tumor size of 2.7 cm corresponds to T1b.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N)**: There is metastatic adenocarcinoma in 1 out of 4 peribronchial lymph nodes (N1). There is no metastatic carcinoma identified in the R4 lymph node (0/1) or the station 11 lymph node (0/1).

3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the pathology report.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* T1b (primary tumor size)

14,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

The primary tumor (T) is described as a 4 cm adenocarcinoma, acinar type, grade III, invading the visceral pleura. This corresponds to a pT2 tumor.

The lymph nodes (N) are involved, with metastatic adenocarcinoma found in two of four lymph nodes (2/4) in the right lower lobe and one of five lymph nodes (1/5) in the level 7 lymph node. This corresponds to a pN2 lymph node status.

There is no mention of distant metastases (M) in the report, so the M status is unknown (Mx).

According to the AJCC staging system, a pT2 tumor with pN2 lymph node status and unknown M status corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
15,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary tumor (T)**: The report mentions an ""invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma"" in the right lung, measuring 9.2 cm in greatest dimension, invading into the chest wall (pT3).
2. **Lymph node involvement (N)**: The report states that 19 peribronchial lymph nodes are negative for carcinoma (0/19), and 6 lymph nodes from levels 1-9 are also negative (0/6). However, the tumor is classified as N1, indicating ipsilateral hilar and/or peribronchial lymph node involvement (levels 10-14).
3. **Distant metastasis (M)**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so we can assume Mx (unknown) or M0 (no distant metastasis).

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* T3 (primary tumor size > 5 cm and invading into the chest wall)
* N1 (ipsilateral hilar and/or peribronchial lymph node involvement)
* Mx or M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 7th Edition, the stage corresponding to T3N1Mx/M0 is **Stage III**.

Therefore, the answer is:

16,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (pT)**: The report states that the tumor is 6.9 x 4.7 x 4.1 cm in size, which corresponds to a pT2b classification (tumor greater than 5 cm, but 7 cm or less in greatest dimension).

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN)**: The report indicates that 7 out of 19 lymph nodes examined are positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma, which corresponds to a pN2 classification (metastasis in ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph node(s)).

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM)**: There is no evidence of distant metastasis mentioned in the report, so pM0.

Based on the TNM descriptors, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* pT2b (primary tumor)
* pN2 (regional lymph nodes)
* pM0 (distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a pT2b, pN2, pM0 classification corresponds to **Stage III**.

17,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report appears to be a general pathology report information form, but it lacks specific details about the tumor, such as tumor size, lymph node involvement, and metastasis.

2. The report does not provide any information about the tumor size (T), lymph node involvement (N), or distant metastasis (M), which are essential components in determining the AJCC stage.

3. Without this information, it is not possible to accurately determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

4. Therefore, we cannot select a specific stage (I, II, III, or IV) based on the provided pathology report.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Cannot be determined from the provided pathology report""}"
18,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the Cancer.

1. The diagnosis mentions a ""peripheral, well-differentiated papillary, non-mucigenous adenocarcinoma"" in the right lower lobe, which indicates the primary tumor site.
2. The tumor measures 50 mm, which is a significant size.
3. The report states that the tumor extends to the visceral pleura, but it is ""just tumor-free,"" implying that the tumor has not breached the pleura.
4. The tumor classification is M-8140/3, which is a specific code for adenocarcinoma.
5. The report provides specific TNM staging information: pT2, pN0, and pMX.
   - pT2 indicates that the tumor is larger than 3 cm but not more than 5 cm in greatest dimension, or it is any size with extension to the visceral pleura (which is the case here).
   - pN0 indicates that there is no regional lymph node metastasis.
   - pMX indicates that distant metastasis cannot be assessed.
6. The report explicitly states ""stage I B"" which is a more specific classification within Stage I.

Considering the tumor size, extension to the visceral pleura, and the absence of lymph node metastasis, the correct stage is Stage I B.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I B""}"
19,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor characteristics and lymph node status.

From the pathology report, we know that:

* The tumor is located in the left upper lobe, is 4.5 cm in size, and has visceral pleural invasion.
* The lymph node status shows that out of 6 lymph nodes received, 1 lymph node contains metastatic carcinoma with extracapsular extension and invasion of the adjacent artery wall.

Based on the TNM staging system, the primary tumor (T) is classified as T2a (tumor size 4.5 cm, but not more than 5 cm). The lymph node status (N) is classified as N1 (metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes).

Since there is no evidence of distant metastasis (M), the M stage is MX (cannot be assessed).

Therefore, the overall stage is Stage IIA (T2aN1MX).

Therefore, the answer is -

1. The tumor site is the upper lobe of the right lung, and the tumor size is 3.7 cm, 2.9 x 2.8 cm, and 1.2 cm x 0.8 cm x 0.7 cm, indicating a T3 tumor (since it's larger than 3 cm).
2. The visceral pleural invasion is not identified, and the tumor extension is not identified, which means there is no invasion into the visceral pleura or other structures.
3. The margins are uninvolved by invasive carcinoma, and the distance of invasive carcinoma from the closest margin is 3.4 cm.
4. Lymph nodes are negative for malignancy (0/11), which means N0.
5. There is no mention of distant metastasis, so M0.

Based on the above information, the AJCC stage is pT3, pNO, and pM0, which corresponds to Stage IIB.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IIB""}"
32,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to analyze the pathology report and identify the key components that contribute to the staging.

From the report, we can see that the primary tumor (PT) is classified as T2, which means the tumor is greater than 3 cm in greatest dimension.

The regional lymph nodes (PN) are classified as N1, which indicates metastases in ipsilateral peribronchial and ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes. The number of lymph nodes examined is two, and one is involved.

The distant metastasis (MX) is not specified, which means there is no evidence of distant metastases.

The margins are uninvolved by invasive carcinoma, and the distance of invasive carcinoma from the closest margin is 5 mm.

Additionally, the report mentions visceral pleura invasion, venous (large vessel) invasion, arterial (large vessel) invasion, and lymphatic (small vessel) invasion.

Based on these findings, we can conclude that the patient has a T2N1M0 tumor, which corresponds to Stage III according to the AJCC staging system.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
33,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Primary tumor (pT): The primary tumor measures 2.5 cm in greatest dimensions, and there is a suggestion of visceral pleural invasion. This corresponds to a pT2a tumor.

2. Regional lymph nodes (pN): The level 12 lymph nodes demonstrate four nodes with evidence of metastasis. This indicates that the cancer has spread to the regional lymph nodes, which corresponds to a pN2 tumor.

3. Distant metastasis (pM): The report states that distant metastasis cannot be evaluated by this specimen, so we cannot determine if there is distant metastasis or not.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage of the cancer. The primary tumor is pT2a, and the regional lymph nodes are pN2. According to the AJCC staging system, this corresponds to Stage IIIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IIIA}"
34,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Primary tumor (pT): The tumor measures 3.5 cm in maximum dimension and invades into the pleura, which corresponds to pT2.

2. Regional lymph nodes (pN): The report states pNX, which means the lymph nodes were not assessed.

3. Distant metastasis (pM): The report states pMX, which means distant metastasis was not assessed.

Based on the information provided, we can determine the T stage as T2 (tumor size > 3 cm and invades the pleura). Since the lymph nodes and distant metastasis were not assessed, we cannot determine the N and M stages.

However, since the tumor invades the pleura, it is likely that the cancer has spread to the pleura, which would correspond to a minimum of Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
35,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the Cancer.

1. The report mentions ""Pathologic stage is T2N0MX"". This indicates that the tumor is classified as T2 (tumor size is between 2-5 cm), N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis), and MX (distant metastasis cannot be assessed).

2. The tumor size is 2.8 cm, which falls within the T2 category.

3. There is no regional lymph node metastasis (N0), as all sampled lymph nodes are benign.

4. There is no mention of distant metastasis, so MX is appropriate.

5. The report also mentions angiolymphatic and visceral pleural invasion, which is a feature of the primary tumor and does not affect the N or M classification.

6. Based on the TNM classification, a T2N0MX corresponds to Stage IIA according to the AJCC 8th edition staging system.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IIA}"
36,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor site is in the middle lobe of the right lung, and the maximum tumor size is 5.5 x 5.0 cm, which is a significant size.

2. The histologic type is non-small cell carcinoma, and the histologic grade is G3, poorly differentiated.

3. Visceral pleural invasion is negative, but tumor extension into the fissure is present.

4. The bronchial margin is negative for tumor, and vascular parenchymal parietal pleural margins are all negative for carcinoma.

5. Lymph vascular invasion is indeterminate but favors present.

6. Twelve lymph nodes, including parts A through E, are examined, and at least one of them is positive (paratracheal lymph node, subcarinal lymph node, etc.).

7. The pathologic stage is reported as pT2, but the nodal status is not explicitly stated as N0, N1, N2, or N3.

Considering the above points, we can conclude that the tumor is at least T2 (due to its size) and has nodal involvement (N2, as there are multiple positive lymph nodes). Therefore, the overall stage is at least Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
37,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can see that the tumor size is 7 cm, which corresponds to T2 (tumor > 5 cm in greatest dimension).

The lymph node involvement is crucial in determining the stage. The report shows that there is no tumor seen in the mediastinal lymph node (level 9), right level 4 lymph node, and level 7 lymph nodes. However, the hilar lymph nodes are not explicitly mentioned as negative or positive for tumor. Since the hilar lymph nodes are part of the N1 category, we cannot assume they are negative. Therefore, we should consider the N1 category as positive.

The tumor has not invaded the visceral pleura, which is a good prognostic factor.

There is no evidence of distant metastasis (M0) in the report.

Based on the above information, we can conclude that the tumor is T2, N1, and M0, which corresponds to Stage IIA according to the AJCC 8th edition staging system.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IIA}"
38,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Primary tumor (pT): The report states that the tumor size is 3.5 cm, which corresponds to pT2a (tumor more than 3 cm but 5 cm or less).

2. Regional lymph nodes (pN): The report mentions that there are metastases in 3 of 18 lymph nodes, specifically in ipsilateral peribronchial lymph nodes, which corresponds to pN1.

3. Distant metastases (pM): There is no mention of distant metastases in the report.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* pT2a (primary tumor) + pN1 (regional lymph nodes) = Stage IIB (according to the 7th edition AJCC staging system).

However, since the report does not mention any distant metastases, we can rule out Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IIB}"
