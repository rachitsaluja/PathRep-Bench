Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor (pT) is classified as pT3, which means the tumor is larger than 5 cm or has invaded the mediastinum or involves the visceral pleura.
2. The regional lymph nodes (pN) are classified as pN1, which means there is metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes.
3. The metastasis (pM) is classified as pMX, which means distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Based on the pT3 and pN1 classifications, the AJCC stage is Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
1,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions a 1.1 cm moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in the lung, which is T1a according to the AJCC 8th edition staging system (tumor size ≤ 1 cm).
2. The tumor invades the overlying pleura, which is classified as PL1 (invasion of visceral pleura). This does not affect the T stage.
3. There is no lymphovascular invasion (LVI) mentioned in the report.
4. The report states that the benign intrapulmonary lymph node is negative for carcinoma, indicating that there is no nodal involvement (N0).
5. The margin of resection is negative for carcinoma, which is not relevant for staging.
6. The sixth rib resection is negative for carcinoma, which suggests that there is no distant metastasis (M0).

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* T stage: T1a (tumor size ≤ 1 cm)
* N stage: N0 (no nodal involvement)
* M stage: M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T1a, N0, M0 tumor corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
2,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor (T) is described as a 27 mm poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma in the right upper lobe, with focal blood vessel and perineural invasion, but no lymphatic permeation. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, this corresponds to a T1 tumor (since it is ≤ 3 cm in size).

2. The report mentions hilar lymph node metastases, which indicates that the cancer has spread to the regional lymph nodes. This corresponds to an N1 designation (since the cancer has spread to the hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes, but not to more distant lymph nodes).

3. There is no evidence of distant metastases (M) in the report, so we can assume M0.

4. Combining the T, N, and M designations, we get a stage of T1N1M0, which corresponds to Stage IIA according to the AJCC 8th edition staging system.

However, the options provided do not include Stage IIA. The closest match is Stage II, which is a reasonable approximation given the T1N1M0 designation.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
3,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the left lung, and it is a Grade II-III squamous carcinoma that involves the pleura and focally extends to the inked pleural margin.
2. The vascular and bronchial margins of resection are negative, indicating that the tumor has not invaded these areas.
3. There are six lymph nodes in the left lung, and all of them are negative for tumor (0/6).
4. The report also mentions lymph nodes from levels 5, 7, 9, and 10, but all of them are negative for tumor.

Based on the TNM staging system, the primary tumor (T) is classified as T2 or T3, depending on the size of the tumor (not specified in the report). Since the tumor involves the pleura, it is at least T2.

The lymph nodes (N) are classified as N0, since none of the lymph nodes examined are positive for tumor.

The metastasis (M) is classified as M0, since there is no evidence of distant metastasis.

According to the AJCC staging system, a T2 or T3 tumor with N0 lymph nodes and M0 metastasis corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
4,"## Answer

{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
6,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor (pT) is classified as pT2a, which means the tumor is > 3 cm and < 5 cm in greatest dimension, surrounded by lung or visceral pleura, without bronchoscopic evidence of invasion in the main bronchus.
2. The regional lymph nodes (pN) are classified as pNO, which means there is no regional lymph node metastasis.
3. There is no mention of distant metastasis (pM) in the report.

Based on the TNM classification, the patient's cancer can be staged as follows:

* Tumor (T): T2a (primary tumor is > 3 cm and < 5 cm in greatest dimension)
* Node (N): N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis)
* Metastasis (M): M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a patient with a T2a, N0, M0 classification corresponds to Stage II.

7,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumour size is 45 mm in diameter, which corresponds to T2a (tumour > 3 cm but ≤ 5 cm).
2. The tumour abuts the visceral pleura, but there is no pleural invasion.
3. The tumour is clear of the bronchial resection margin, with no lymphatic, vascular, or perineural invasion present.
4. The peribronchial lymph nodes, left hilar lymph node, and mediastinal lymph node are not involved by tumour, indicating N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis).

Based on the TNM classification, the patient has a T2a N0 tumour. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2a N0 tumour corresponds to Stage I.

8,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions a primary tumor in the right lower lobe of the lung, measuring 5 x 4.5 x 2.6 cm, which is a significant size. However, it does not extend through the pleura, which suggests that the tumor is still localized within the lung.

2. The bronchial margin is negative for tumor, indicating that the tumor has not invaded the bronchus.

3. Multiple intrapulmonary peribronchial lymph nodes are negative for tumor, which suggests that the tumor has not spread to the regional lymph nodes within the lung.

4. The report also mentions that multiple superior and inferior mediastinal lymph nodes, as well as N1 lymph nodes, are negative for tumor. This indicates that the tumor has not spread to the mediastinal lymph nodes or the N1 lymph nodes.

Based on these findings, we can conclude that the tumor is localized within the lung, has not invaded the pleura or bronchus, and has not spread to the regional lymph nodes. This corresponds to the T2 category (tumor > 4 cm in greatest dimension) and N0 category (no regional lymph node metastasis).

According to the AJCC staging system, a T2N0 tumor corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
9,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the left upper lobe of the lung, and its greatest diameter is 3.2 cm, which corresponds to a T2 tumor (T1: ≤ 3 cm, T2: > 3 cm but ≤ 5 cm, T3: > 5 cm but ≤ 7 cm, T4: > 7 cm).
2. The tumor involves the visceral pleura, but there is no vascular invasion, perineural invasion, or bronchial margin involvement.
3. The lymph node status is as follows: peribronchial lymph nodes are 0/8, indicating no metastasis to these nodes.
4. Multiple mediastinal lymph nodes were examined (Levels 5, 6, 7, and 11), and all were benign, with no evidence of metastasis.

Based on the above information, we can determine the N stage as N0, since there is no metastasis to any of the examined lymph nodes.

Combining the T and N stages, we get a stage of T2N0. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2N0 tumor corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage II}"
10,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

First, we need to identify the primary tumor (pT) stage, which is pT1b. This indicates that the tumor is 2 cm or less in size and has not invaded the visceral pleura.

Next, we need to determine the regional lymph node (pN) stage, which is pNO. This means that the lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

Since the lymph nodes are negative, we can rule out Stage III and Stage IV, which would require lymph node involvement.

Now, let's look at the distant metastasis (pM) stage, which is not applicable. This means that there is no evidence of distant metastasis.

Given the pT1b and pNO stages, we can conclude that the cancer is localized to the primary site and has not spread to the lymph nodes or distant sites.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
11,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary tumor (T stage)**: The report states that the tumor is an invasive squamous cell carcinoma, 4.5 cm in diameter, with visceral pleural and angiolymphatic invasion. This corresponds to a T4 stage, as the tumor has invaded the visceral pleura.

2. **Lymph node involvement (N stage)**: The report mentions that one out of 12 N1 lymph nodes is positive for metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. This corresponds to an N1 stage, as there is involvement of ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes.

3. **Distant metastasis (M stage)**: The report does not mention any distant metastases, so the M stage is MX (cannot be assessed).

Based on the T4N1MX staging, the AJCC stage of the cancer is **Stage III**.

Therefore, the answer is -

12,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the Cancer:

1. The report mentions a 2.3 x 2 x 1.8 cm mass in the left upper lobe lung, which is a primary tumor (T). Since it abuts but does not directly invade the pleura, it is classified as T1 (tumor ≤ 3 cm in greatest dimension, surrounded by lung or visceral pleura, and does not invade the visceral pleura).

2. The report states that the bronchial margin is negative, indicating that there is no tumor involvement at the bronchial resection margin.

3. The report mentions that multiple lymph nodes were excised, including inferior mediastinal, aortic, and N1 lymph nodes. However, all of these lymph nodes are negative for tumor, indicating that there is no nodal involvement (N0).

4. Since there is no mention of distant metastases (M) in the report, we can assume that there is no evidence of distant metastases (M0).

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC Stage of the Cancer as follows:

* T1 (primary tumor ≤ 3 cm in greatest dimension)
* N0 (no nodal involvement)
* M0 (no distant metastases)

According to the AJCC 8th Edition Staging System, a T1N0M0 classification corresponds to Stage I.

2. The pleura, bronchial, and vascular margins are negative for tumor, indicating that the tumor has not invaded these structures.
3. There is no involvement of the peribronchial lymph nodes (N0).
4. The tumor has invaded the left main bronchus, but there is no evidence of distant metastasis (M0).
5. The lymph nodes in the inferior pulmonary vein, level 5, level 7, and level 9 are all negative for tumor, indicating that the tumor has not metastasized to these lymph nodes.

Based on the above findings, the tumor is classified as PT2N0M0, which corresponds to Stage II according to the AJCC staging system.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
14,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to analyze the pathology report and identify the key components that contribute to the staging.

First, we look at the Pathological T (pT) stage, which is T2a. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual, T2a corresponds to a tumor size between 3 cm and 5 cm.

Next, we examine the Pathological N (pN) stage, which is N1. This indicates that there is metastasis to 1-3 axillary lymph nodes.

The Clinical M (cM) stage is MO, indicating that there is no distant metastasis.

Now, we can combine the pT and pN stages to determine the overall stage. Based on the AJCC 8th edition staging manual, a T2a tumor with N1 lymph node involvement corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
15,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Tumor size**: The tumor size is 3 X 3 X 3.5 cm, which is a significant factor in determining the T stage. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a tumor of this size would correspond to a T2 stage (tumors > 3 cm but ≤ 5 cm in greatest dimension).

2. **Lymph nodes**: The report does not specify the involvement of lymph nodes, which means we cannot determine the N stage from this information.

3. **Metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, which suggests that the M stage is likely M0 (no distant metastasis).

4. **Tumor extent**: The report does not specify the tumor extent, which could be a crucial factor in determining the T stage. However, based on the tumor size, we can infer that the tumor is likely confined to the lung.

Considering the available information, we can conclude that the tumor is at least T2 (due to its size) and M0 (no distant metastasis). Since there is no information about lymph node involvement, we cannot determine the N stage.

Given the options, the most likely answer is **(A) Stage I**, as it is possible that the tumor is T2N0M0, which corresponds to Stage I. However, please note that this is an incomplete pathology report, and a more comprehensive report would be necessary to determine the stage with certainty.

Therefore, the answer is -

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (T)**: The tumor size is 4.2 x 4.0 x 2.3 cm, which corresponds to T2a (tumor > 3 cm but ≤ 5 cm in greatest dimension).
2. **Visceral Pleural Invasion (VPI)**: The report mentions ""Tumor invades the pleura"" under Surgical Margin Status, which indicates VPI is present.
3. **Lymph Node Status (N)**: Only 1 peribronchial node was received, and it did not contain metastatic carcinoma, so N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis).
4. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so M0 (no distant metastasis).

Based on the above information, the pTNM stage is pT2a NO, which corresponds to **Stage II** according to the AJCC 8th edition staging system.

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

First, we need to identify the T, N, and M stages from the report.

* T stage: The tumour is 57 mm in greatest dimension, and it invades into the pericardium. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, this corresponds to a T3 stage (tumour > 5 cm or invading the pericardium).
* N stage: The report states ""No lymph node metastases"", which corresponds to an N0 stage.
* M stage: There is no mention of distant metastases in the report, so we can assume an M0 stage.

Now, we can determine the overall stage based on the T, N, and M stages. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T3 N0 M0 stage corresponds to Stage III.

2. The tumor has extensive vascular invasion and focal perineural invasion, but no lymphatic invasion.
3. The soft tissue resection margin is clear of malignancy, and the upper lobe resection margin is also clear of malignancy.
4. The lymph node sampling reveals metastatic carcinoma in one of the lymph nodes (No. 11 lymph node), which corresponds to N1.

Based on the TNM classification, the patient has a T3 primary tumor with N1 lymph node involvement. According to the AJCC staging system, this corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
21,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the primary tumor (T), lymph nodes (N), and distant metastasis (M).

From the pathology report, we can gather the following information:

* Primary tumor (T): The tumor is 6.4 cm in size, and it invades the adjacent structure, which is the chest wall and rib (T3).
* Lymph nodes (N): All sampled lymph nodes (8) are benign, which means there is no lymph node involvement (N0).
* Distant metastasis (M): There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so we can assume M0.

Based on the TNM classification, the patient has a pT3N0M0 tumor.

According to the AJCC staging system, a pT3N0M0 tumor corresponds to Stage IIB.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IIB}"
22,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to analyze the pathology report and identify the key features that determine the stage.

From the report, we can see that the tumor is a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with a diameter of 5.0 cm, which corresponds to a T2 tumor size (T2: tumor > 3 cm but ≤ 5 cm).

The report also mentions that there is no evidence of visceral pleural or angiolymphatic invasion, which suggests that the tumor has not invaded the visceral pleura or lymphatic vessels.

Regarding lymph node involvement, the report states that one of fifteen N1 lymph nodes is positive for metastases, which indicates that the tumor has spread to the regional lymph nodes (N1). However, there is no evidence of metastases in the N2 lymph nodes.

There is no mention of distant metastases (M) in the report, which suggests that the tumor has not spread to distant organs or tissues.

Based on these findings, the pathologic stage is T2N1MX, which corresponds to Stage IIA according to the AJCC 8th edition staging system.

Therefore, the answer is -

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the left lung, and it measures 11.0 cm in its greatest dimension. This corresponds to a T2 tumor, as it is larger than 5 cm but not more than 10 cm.
2. The visceral pleural, bronchial, and vascular margins are negative for tumor, indicating that the tumor has not invaded these structures.
3. One out of twelve peribronchial lymph nodes is positive for metastatic carcinoma, which corresponds to N1 disease (metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial and/or hilar lymph nodes).
4. There is no evidence of distant metastasis (M0) in the report.

According to the AJCC staging system, a T2 tumor with N1 disease and M0 corresponds to Stage IIA.

However, the report also mentions that one of the level 10 lymph nodes is positive for microscopic metastatic carcinoma, which is a contralateral mediastinal lymph node (N3 disease). This upstages the tumor to Stage IIIB.

24,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Tumor size**: The tumor size is 3 x 2 x 2 cm, which is a relatively small size. This suggests that the primary tumor (T) is likely to be T1 or T2, as T3 tumors are typically larger than 5 cm.

2. **Lymph nodes**: The report states that 3 out of 6 lymph nodes are positive for metastasis, which indicates that the cancer has spread to the regional lymph nodes. This corresponds to N2, as N2 is defined as metastasis to ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes.

3. **Distant metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, which suggests that M0 (no distant metastasis) is likely.

4. **Combining T, N, and M**: Based on the above analysis, we have T1 or T2, N2, and M0. According to the AJCC staging system, this corresponds to Stage IIIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IIIA""}"
25,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the cancer.

1. **Tumor size**: The tumor size is 8 x 8 x 8 cm, which is a significant size, but it doesn't directly determine the stage.

2. **Tumor extent**: The tumor has invaded the visceral pleura, which indicates a T2 or higher classification (T2: tumor invades visceral pleura).

3. **Lymph nodes**: 8 out of 10 lymph nodes are positive for metastasis, which is a significant number. This indicates an N2 classification (N2: metastasis to ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes).

4. **Distant metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report.

Considering the above factors, we can determine the TNM classification as follows:

* T: T2 (tumor invades visceral pleura)
* N: N2 (metastasis to ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes)
* M: M0 (no distant metastasis)

27,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor (T) is described as a squamous cell carcinoma, moderately differentiated, with a maximal tumor size of 7.7 cm, and visceral pleura invasion present. This corresponds to a pT2 tumor, as it is greater than 3 cm in greatest dimension and invades the visceral pleura.

2. The lymph nodes (N) are reported as pNO, indicating no regional lymph node metastasis.

3. The metastasis (M) is not assessed (pMX) in this report, but since there is no mention of distant metastases, we can assume it is M0.

Based on the pTNM staging, we have:

* pT2: Tumor with visceral pleura invasion and size > 3 cm
* pNO: No regional lymph node metastasis
* pMX/M0: No distant metastasis

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a pT2 tumor with no lymph node metastasis and no distant metastasis corresponds to Stage II.

28,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the left upper lobe of the lung, measuring 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm, and is 1.8 cm away from the bronchial margin, which is negative for tumor. This suggests that the tumor is confined to the lung and has not invaded the bronchial margin.

2. The report mentions that multiple (10) intrapulmonary peribronchial lymph nodes are positive for tumor, which indicates lymph node involvement.

3. The visceral pleura is also involved, which suggests that the tumor has invaded the pleura.

4. The report also mentions that multiple lymph nodes in the superior mediastinal, aortic, inferior mediastinal, and left lower lobe bronchus regions are negative for tumor.

Considering the above points, we can determine the T, N, and M stages as follows:

* T stage: The tumor is 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm in size and has invaded the visceral pleura, which corresponds to a T2b stage (tumor > 2 cm in greatest dimension and invades the visceral pleura).
* N stage: The presence of tumor in multiple intrapulmonary peribronchial lymph nodes corresponds to an N1 stage (metastasis to intrapulmonary nodes).
* M stage: There is no evidence of distant metastasis, so the M stage is M0.

Based on the T, N, and M stages, we can determine the overall AJCC stage. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2bN1M0 stage corresponds to Stage IIA.

However, since the options provided do not include Stage IIA, we need to consider the closest match. Given that the tumor has invaded the visceral pleura and has lymph node involvement, the closest match would be Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (T)**: The tumor size is 4.5 cm, and it invades the visceral pleura but not the pericardium. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, this corresponds to a T2 tumor.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N)**: The pathology report states that 7 lymph nodes were examined, and none of them were involved by the tumor (pNO). This indicates that the regional lymph nodes are not affected by the cancer.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the pathology report, so we can assume that the cancer has not spread to other parts of the body (pMX).

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage of the cancer. Since the tumor is T2, N0, and MX, it corresponds to **Stage II** according to the AJCC 8th edition staging system.

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (pT)**: The report mentions two lesions, 2.6 cm and 4 cm in greatest dimension, with visceral pleural invasion in the smaller lesion and peripheral extension in the larger lesion. According to the new guidelines, two nodules of similar histology in the same lobe would be classified as pT3.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN)**: The report states that there is metastatic carcinoma in one of three hilar lymph nodes (pN1).

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM)**: The report indicates that there is no distant metastasis (pMX).

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* pT3 (primary tumor with visceral pleural invasion and peripheral extension)

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions the tumor size as 3 X 2.5 X 2 cm, which is a key factor in determining the T stage (primary tumor size).
2. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a tumor size of 3 cm or less corresponds to a T1 stage.
3. There is no mention of lymph node involvement or distant metastases in the report, which suggests that the N stage (lymph node involvement) and M stage (distant metastases) are likely N0 and M0, respectively.
4. Combining the T1 stage with N0 and M0, we can determine the overall stage of the cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
32,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (T)**: The tumor size is 4.0 cm, which corresponds to pT2 (tumor with any of the following features of size or extent: greater than 3 cm in greatest dimension).
2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N)**: One lobar lymph node out of nine lymph nodes is positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma (pN1: Metastasis in ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes, including intrapulmonary nodes involved by direct extension of the primary tumor).
3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so pMX: Cannot be assessed.

Based on the pT2 and pN1 classifications, the patient's cancer is at **Stage II**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
33,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (pT)**: The report states that the tumor measures 4.9 cm in maximum dimension, which corresponds to pT2a (Tumor > 3 cm, and < 5 cm in greatest dimension surrounded by lung or visceral pleura, without bronchoscopic evidence of invasion in the main bronchus).

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN)**: The report indicates that all lymph nodes examined (levels 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10R, and 11) are negative for malignancy, which corresponds to pN0 (No regional lymph node metastasis).

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM)**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, which implies pM0 (No distant metastasis).

Considering the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

**AJCC Stage**: The combination of pT2a, pN0, and pM0 corresponds to **Stage II** (T2a, N0, M0).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
34,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary tumor (pT)**: The tumor measures 5.5 cm in dimension and extends through the pleura but is not identified at the outer surface of the specimen. This corresponds to a T2b tumor (tumor > 5 cm in greatest dimension).
2. **Margins of resection**: The margins are negative for tumor.
3. **Direct extension of tumor**: The tumor extends into the pleura, which shows a desmoplastic response to tumor.
4. **Vessel invasion**: Not identified.
5. **Regional lymph nodes (pN)**: pNO, meaning no regional lymph node metastases are identified.
6. **Distant metastasis (pM)**: pMx, meaning distant metastases cannot be assessed.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* Tumor (T): T2b (tumor > 5 cm in greatest dimension)
* Node (N): N0 (no regional lymph node metastases)
* Metastasis (M): Mx (distant metastases cannot be assessed)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2b tumor with N0 nodes and Mx metastasis corresponds to **Stage II**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
35,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to analyze the pathology report and identify the key factors that affect staging.

First, we need to identify the primary tumor (T) stage. The report states that the tumor size is 4.9 x 4.7 x 4.5 cm, which corresponds to a T3 stage (tumor > 5 cm in greatest dimension).

Next, we need to determine the nodal (N) stage. The report states that the lobar lymph nodes are negative for carcinoma, which corresponds to an N0 stage (no regional lymph node metastases).

Finally, we need to determine the metastasis (M) stage. There is no evidence of distant metastases in the report, which corresponds to an M0 stage (no distant metastases).

Based on the TNM classification, the pathologic stage is pT3 pNO PL3, which corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
36,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer:

1. The primary tumor (T) is described as a 4.5 x 4 x 3 cm intrabronchial and parenchymal hilar mass, which is a significant size. However, there is no mention of invasion into the pleura, which would be a T3 or T4 descriptor. Therefore, the primary tumor is likely a T2.

2. The report mentions that the tumor extends to within a few millimeters of the bronchial margin, which is involved by extensive in situ carcinoma. This does not affect the T stage.

3. The lymph node involvement is extensive, with metastases in multiple intrapulmonary peribronchial lymph nodes (6 of 14), aortopulmonary lymph nodes (2 of 2), and anterior mediastinal lymph nodes (1 of 2). This indicates N2 disease, as there are metastases in mediastinal lymph nodes.

4. There is no mention of distant metastases (M1) in the report.

Based on the above analysis, the TNM stage is T2N2M0, which corresponds to Stage III according to the AJCC staging system.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
37,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the right lower lobe, and it measures 3.5 cm in greatest dimension. This corresponds to a T2a tumor (since it's >3 cm but ≤5 cm).
2. The tumor is predominantly endobronchial but with pulmonary parenchymal invasion. This does not affect the T stage.
3. The closest inked pleural margin is negative for malignancy, and the bronchus and blood vessels at the surgical margin are also negative for malignancy. This indicates that there is no pleural or vascular invasion.
4. There is no lymphovascular invasion mentioned in the report.
5. No hilar lymph nodes are identified, but multiple lymph nodes from different stations (subcarinal, right hilum, and right lower peritracheal area) are examined, and all are benign anthracotic lymph nodes. This indicates that there is no nodal involvement (N0).

Based on the above information, the TNM staging would be T2a N0 M0.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2a N0 M0 tumor corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
38,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the right lower lobe lung, measuring 2.9 x 2.5 x 1.8 cm.
2. The tumor extends subpleurally but not to the pleural surface, which suggests a T2a tumor (since it's larger than 2 cm but not more than 3 cm in greatest dimension, and it doesn't invade the visceral pleura).
3. There is no vascular invasion or perineural invasion identified.
4. The bronchial margin is free of tumor.
5. The lymph node status is as follows: all lymph nodes examined (Level VII mediastinal, Level VII mediastinal #2, Right mediastinal lymph node level XI) are benign, with no metastatic nodes identified. This suggests an N0 lymph node status.
6. There is no evidence of distant metastasis (M0) mentioned in the report.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* T2a (primary tumor size and extension)
* N0 (no lymph node metastasis)
* M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2a, N0, M0 tumor corresponds to Stage I.

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary diagnosis is a large, intermediate to peripheral bronchopulmonary, histologically poorly differentiated, large-cell and polymorphocellular nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma of the right lower lobe of the lung.
2. The TNM classification is provided as pT2 pNO pMX R0, which indicates:
   - pT2: The primary tumor is larger than 3 cm but not more than 5 cm in greatest dimension, or the tumor is more than 5 cm in greatest dimension but does not invade the visceral pleura (in this case, the tumor is 8.5 cm in size, but it does not invade the visceral pleura).
   - pNO: No regional lymph node metastases are present.
   - pMX: The presence of distant metastases cannot be assessed.
   - R0: The surgical margins are tumor-free.
3. The report mentions that the resection margin of the bronchus and vessels and all lymph nodes identified and excised are tumor-free, which supports the pNO classification.
4. There is no evidence of distant metastases (pMX), and the report does not suggest any metastases to other organs or tissues.

Based on the TNM classification, the patient has a pT2 tumor with no regional lymph node metastases (pNO) and no distant metastases (pMX). According to the AJCC staging system, this corresponds to Stage IB.

{""stage"" : ""Stage IB""}"
40,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions that the tumor is staged as pT3 due to the presence of separate tumor nodules in the same lobe, away from the main central tumor.
2. The tumor size is reported as 5.5 cm x 4.0 cm x 3.5 cm, which is greater than 7 cm in greatest dimension, making it a T3 tumor.
3. There is no evidence of chest wall invasion, diaphragmatic invasion, or mediastinal pleura invasion, which would have upgraded the T stage.
4. The report states that all margins are negative for invasive carcinoma, including the bronchial margin, vascular margin, and parenchymal margin.
5. There is no evidence of lymphovascular invasion or extranodal extension.
6. The report mentions that 8 lymph nodes were examined, and none of them showed metastatic carcinoma, making it pN0.
7. There is no mention of distant metastasis, making it pM0.

Based on the above information, the TNM staging is pT3N0M0.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a pT3N0M0 tumor corresponds to Stage II.

41,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor size is 6.5 x 5.5 x 5.5 cm, which is a significant size, but it doesn't directly determine the stage.
2. The histologic type is squamous cell carcinoma, which is a type of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The histologic grade is poorly differentiated, which may affect the prognosis but not the stage.
3. The tumor extent is not specified, which means we can't determine if the tumor has invaded nearby structures or not.
4. The lymph nodes are 0/6 positive for metastasis, which means no lymph nodes are involved. This is a crucial factor in determining the stage.
5. There is no mention of distant metastases or other tumor nodules.

Based on the information provided, we can conclude that the tumor is relatively large (T2 or T3), but there is no lymph node involvement (N0) and no distant metastases (M0). According to the AJCC staging system, this corresponds to Stage II.

49,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions that the carcinoma involves the pleural surface, which indicates that the tumor has invaded the visceral pleura (T2).
2. All surgical margins of resection are negative for tumor, which suggests that the tumor has not invaded the surrounding tissues (R0 resection).
3. The report mentions that one hilar lymph node and associated fibroadipose tissue are negative for tumor, which indicates that there is no lymph node involvement (N0).
4. Additionally, two other lymph nodes (Station 5 and L11) are also negative for tumor, further supporting the absence of lymph node involvement.

Based on the above findings, we can determine the T, N, and M stages as follows:

* T stage: T2 (tumor invades the visceral pleura)
* N stage: N0 (no lymph node involvement)
* M stage: M0 (no distant metastases mentioned in the report)

According to the AJCC staging system, a T2N0M0 corresponds to Stage II.

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor size is 4 X 3 X 3.5 cm, which is larger than 3 cm but not more than 5 cm. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, this corresponds to a T2 tumor.

2. There is no information about tumor extent, lymph nodes, lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, or margins, which are important factors in determining the N and M components of the TNM staging system. However, the absence of information does not necessarily imply the absence of these features.

3. Since there is no information about lymph node involvement or distant metastases, we cannot determine the N and M components. However, we can infer that the M component is likely M0 (no distant metastases) since there is no mention of metastases in the report.

4. Given the T2 tumor and unknown N and M components, the minimum stage would be Stage II (T2N0M0). However, without more information, we cannot rule out the possibility of lymph node involvement or distant metastases, which would correspond to a higher stage.

3. Visceral pleural invasion is not identified, but lymphovascular space invasion is suspected.
4. The tumor appears confined to the lung, and the distance from the bronchial margin is 2.0 cm.
5. The distance from the pleural surface is less than 0.1 cm.
6. Lymph node status: 2 lymph nodes were received, and none of them contain metastatic carcinoma (0/2).
7. The pTN stage is initially reported as pT1bNO, but upon re-review, it is revised to pT3NO due to the presence of a satellite tumor.

Based on the revised pT3NO classification, the AJCC stage is determined as follows:

* T3: The tumor is larger than 5 cm or has multiple tumors in the same lobe.
* N0: No lymph nodes contain metastatic carcinoma.
* M0: Not mentioned in the report, but implied to be M0 since there is no mention of distant metastases.
