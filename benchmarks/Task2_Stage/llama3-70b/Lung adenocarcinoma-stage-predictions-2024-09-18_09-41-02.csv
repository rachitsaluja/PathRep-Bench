Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (pT)**: The report mentions two separate primary tumors, one in the lingula (1 cm) and another in the left lower lobe (3.5 cm). Both tumors are adenocarcinomas with different histological subtypes. The larger tumor (3.5 cm) is classified as pT2a, as it is greater than 3 cm but not more than 5 cm in greatest dimension.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN)**: The report states that four lymph nodes were negative for carcinoma (0/4), indicating that there is no regional lymph node metastasis. Therefore, pN is classified as pN0.

3. **Distant Metastases (pM)**: There is no mention of distant metastases in the report, so pM is classified as pM0.

Considering the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* pT2a (primary tumor size > 3 cm but ≤ 5 cm)
* pN0 (no regional lymph node metastasis)
* pM0 (no distant metastases)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, the stage corresponding to pT2a, pN0, and pM0 is **Stage II**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
1,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the right lower lobe of the lung, and its size is 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.6 cm, which corresponds to a T2 tumor (tumor size > 2 cm but ≤ 5 cm).
2. The tumor invades the pleura, but there is no lymphovascular space invasion.
3. The surgical margin status shows that the tumor is 2.8 cm away from the bronchial margin and less than 0.5 cm away from the pleural surface, focally involving the pleura.
4. The lymph node status is N0, as all lymph nodes (stations 4, 7, 11, and 12) are negative for tumor.

Based on these findings, the TNM classification is T2N0. According to the AJCC staging system, a T2N0 tumor corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
2,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Primary tumor (pT): The report states that the tumor size is 2.8 cm (greatest dimension), and it is classified as pT1b, which corresponds to a tumor larger than 2 cm but not more than 3 cm in greatest dimension.

2. Regional lymph nodes (pN): The report indicates that 1 out of 17 lymph nodes are involved (pN1). Specifically, 1 lymph node in the peribronchial region of the left lower lobe is positive for malignancy.

3. Distant metastasis (pM): The report states that the distant metastasis status is pMX, which means it cannot be assessed.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* The primary tumor is classified as pT1b, which corresponds to a T1 tumor.
* The regional lymph nodes are classified as pN1, which corresponds to an N1 tumor.
* There is no evidence of distant metastasis.

According to the AJCC staging system, a T1 tumor with N1 nodes corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
3,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The tumor size is 2.5 x 2.0 cm, which corresponds to pT1 (tumor size ≤ 3 cm).
* Ten out of twelve lymph nodes are involved by metastatic carcinoma, including the subcarinal lymph node, which indicates pN2 (metastasis to ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes).
* There is no distant metastasis (pMX).

According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor with pT1 and pN2 corresponds to Stage IIIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IIIA}"
4,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN)**: The report indicates that there is no regional lymph node metastasis (pN0).
3. **Distant Metastases (pM)**: There is no mention of distant metastases, so pM0.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage using the TNM staging system.

**Stage**: The combination of pT1b, pN0, and pM0 corresponds to **Stage I**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
6,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the right lower lobe lung and measures 5 x 4 x 3 cm, which corresponds to a T2 tumor (since it's larger than 3 cm but not more than 5 cm).
2. The bronchial margin is negative for tumor, indicating that the tumor has not invaded the bronchus.
3. One of the six intrapulmonary peribronchial lymph nodes is positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma, which indicates N1 disease (metastasis to intrapulmonary lymph nodes).
4. The report does not mention any distant metastases (M1 disease).

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* T2 (primary tumor size)
* N1 (metastasis to intrapulmonary lymph nodes)
* M0 (no distant metastases)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2N1M0 tumor corresponds to Stage IIA.

Therefore, the answer is -

3. There is no metastatic carcinoma identified in the lymph nodes (0/2, 0/3, 0/1).
4. The pTN stage is pT1b NO, which indicates that the tumor is 2.3 cm in size and has no lymph node involvement.

Based on the above information, the AJCC stage of the cancer is Stage I, as it meets the criteria for pT1b NO.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
8,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary tumor (T)**: The tumor size is 3.5 x 2.4 x 2.3 cm, and it does not grossly appear to involve the bronchus, but it is close to the bronchial margin (0.3 cm). Therefore, the T stage is T2a (tumor >2 cm but ≤3 cm in greatest dimension).

2. **Lymph nodes (N)**: Metastatic adenocarcinoma is present in 1 out of 4 hilar lymph nodes (N1). There are also multiple negative lymph nodes in other stations.

3. **Distant metastasis (M)**: There is no evidence of distant metastasis in the report.

Based on the above information, the AJCC stage can be determined as follows:

* T stage: T2a
* N stage: N1
* M stage: M0

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2a, N1, M0 corresponds to **Stage IIA**.

Therefore, the answer is -

9,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions a left lower lobectomy with a tumor measuring 50 x 60 x 45 mm, which involves the posterior lateral basal and anterior basal segments. This suggests a significant tumor size, but no specific T stage is mentioned.

2. The tumor appears to surround a major segmental bronchus and extends close to the bronchial resection margin, but the medial margin is not involved. This implies that the tumor is likely to be T2, as it has not invaded the mediastinum or surrounding structures.

3. The report mentions that the tumor probably does not involve the pleura, and this is confirmed by special stains in the addendum report. This rules out any pleural invasion, which would have upgraded the T stage.

4. The report also mentions that there is no vascular or perineural invasion, and no metastases to hilar lymph nodes are seen. This suggests that the N stage is N0.

5. The report does not mention any distant metastases, so the M stage is Mx (unknown).

6. Based on the TNM staging system, a T2N0Mx corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
10,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Tumor size**: The tumor size is 3 x 3 x 3 cm, which is a significant factor in determining the T stage. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a tumor of this size corresponds to a T2 stage (tumors > 3 cm in greatest dimension).

2. **Tumor extent**: The tumor extends to the visceral pleura, which indicates a T2 stage as well.

3. **Lymph nodes**: One out of one lymph node is positive for metastasis, which is an N1 stage (metastasis to intrathoracic lymph nodes).

4. **Distant metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so we can assume M0 (no distant metastasis).

Now, let's combine the T, N, and M stages to determine the overall stage. With a T2 stage, N1 stage, and M0 stage, the patient's cancer corresponds to **Stage III** according to the AJCC 8th edition staging system.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
11,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor size is 4.0 X 3.5 X 2.0 cm, which corresponds to a pT2 classification, indicating a tumor larger than 3 cm but not more than 5 cm in greatest dimension.

2. The report states ""pNO (0/20)"", which means there is no lymph node involvement (NO) and 0 out of 20 lymph nodes examined were positive for cancer.

3. There is no mention of distant metastases, and the report states ""pMx"", which means the presence or absence of distant metastases cannot be assessed.

4. The tumor has infiltrated the pleura visceralis, which is a key factor in determining the T stage.

Considering the above factors, the tumor is classified as pT2 (tumor size), pNO (no lymph node involvement), and pMx (unknown distant metastases). According to the AJCC staging system, this corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
12,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (T)**: The tumor size is 2.7 cm in diameter, and it does not grossly involve the bronchus. The distance to the bronchial margin is approximately 2.9 cm. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a tumor size of 2.7 cm corresponds to T1b.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N)**: There is metastatic adenocarcinoma in 1 out of 4 peribronchial lymph nodes (N1). There is no extracapsular extension.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: There is no evidence of distant metastasis in the report.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* T1b (primary tumor size 2.7 cm)
* N1 (metastasis in 1 out of 4 peribronchial lymph nodes)
* M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, the combination of T1b, N1, and M0 corresponds to **Stage IIA**.

13,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary tumor (T)**: The tumor size is 1.2 cm, and it focally invades into, but not through, the visceral pleura. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual, this corresponds to a T1 tumor.

2. **Lymph nodes (N)**: The report states that 7 lymph nodes were examined, and none of them were involved with cancer (0/7). Therefore, the lymph node status is N0.

3. **Metastasis (M)**: There is no mention of distant metastases in the report. The MX designation in the TNM staging section suggests that metastasis was not assessed or was unknown, but based on the available information, it is reasonable to assume that M0 (no metastasis) is the most likely scenario.

Considering the T1, N0, and M0 designations, the AJCC stage of the cancer is **Stage I**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
14,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

The primary tumor (T) is described as a 4 cm adenocarcinoma, acinar type, grade III, invading the visceral pleura. This corresponds to a pT2 classification.

The lymph nodes (N) are involved, with metastatic adenocarcinoma found in two of four lymph nodes (2/4) in the right lower lobe and one of five lymph nodes (1/5) in the level 7 lymph node. This corresponds to a pN2 classification.

There is no mention of distant metastases (M), so the M classification is pMx (cannot be assessed).

According to the AJCC staging system, a pT2, pN2, pMx classification corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is -

1. **Primary tumor (T)**: The report mentions an ""invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma"" in the right lung, measuring 9.2 cm in greatest dimension, invading into the chest wall (pT3).
2. **Lymph node involvement (N)**: The report states that 19 peribronchial lymph nodes are negative for carcinoma (0/19), and 6 lymph nodes from levels 1-9 are also negative (0/6). However, the tumor is classified as N1, indicating ipsilateral hilar and/or peribronchial lymph node involvement (levels 10-14).
3. **Distant metastasis (M)**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so we can assume Mx (unknown) or M0 (no distant metastasis).

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* T3 (primary tumor size > 5 cm and invading into the chest wall)
* N1 (ipsilateral hilar and/or peribronchial lymph node involvement)
* Mx or M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 7th Edition, the stage corresponding to T3N1Mx/M0 is **Stage III**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IIB""}"
32,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (PT)**: The report states that the tumor size is 3.5 cm, which corresponds to T2 (Tumor greater than 3 cm in greatest dimension).
2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (PN)**: The report indicates that there are metastases in ipsilateral peribronchial and ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes, which corresponds to N1 (Metastases in ipsilateral peribronchial and ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes).
3. **Distant Metastasis (MX)**: There is no evidence of distant metastasis, so MX is not applicable.
4. **Margins**: The margins are uninvolved by invasive carcinoma, and the distance of invasive tumor from the closest margin is 5 mm.
5. **Direct Extension of Tumor**: The tumor has extended to the visceral pleura.
6. **Lymphovascular Invasion**: There is evidence of venous, arterial, and lymphatic invasion.

Considering these factors, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* T2 (Primary Tumor size > 3 cm)
* N1 (Metastases in ipsilateral peribronchial and ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes)
* MX (No distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC staging system, this corresponds to **Stage III**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
33,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Primary tumor (pT): The primary tumor measures 2.5 cm in greatest dimension, and there is a suggestion of visceral pleural invasion. This corresponds to a pT2a tumor.

2. Regional lymph nodes (pN): The level 12 lymph nodes demonstrate four nodes with evidence of metastasis. This indicates that the cancer has spread to the regional lymph nodes, which corresponds to a pN2 tumor.

3. Distant metastasis (pM): The report states that distant metastasis cannot be evaluated by this specimen, so we cannot determine if there is distant metastasis or not.

Based on the pT2a and pN2 classifications, the AJCC stage of the cancer is Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
34,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Primary tumor (pT): The tumor measures 3.5 cm in maximum dimension and invades into the pleura, which corresponds to pT2.

2. Regional lymph nodes (pN): The report states pNX, which means the lymph nodes were not assessed.

3. Distant metastasis (pM): The report states pMX, which means distant metastasis was not assessed.

Based on the information provided, we can determine the T stage as T2 (tumor size > 3 cm and invades into the pleura). Since the lymph nodes and distant metastasis were not assessed, we cannot determine the N and M stages.

However, since the tumor invades into the pleura, it is likely that the cancer has spread to the pleura, which would correspond to a minimum of Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
35,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions ""Pathologic stage is T2N0MX"". This indicates that the tumor is classified as T2 (tumor size is between 2-5 cm), N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis), and MX (distant metastasis cannot be assessed).

2. The tumor size is 2.8 cm, which falls within the T2 category.

3. There is no regional lymph node metastasis (N0), as all sampled lymph nodes are benign.

4. There is no mention of distant metastasis, so MX is appropriate.

5. The report also mentions angiolymphatic and visceral pleural invasion, which is a feature of the primary tumor and does not affect the N or M classification.

Based on the TNM classification, the patient has a T2N0MX tumor, which corresponds to Stage IIA according to the AJCC 8th edition staging system.

However, since Stage IIA is not an option, we need to consider the closest match. Stage I includes T1 and T2 tumors with N0 and M0, which matches the patient's tumor characteristics.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
36,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor site is in the middle lobe of the right lung, and the maximum tumor size is 5.5 x 5.0 cm, which is a significant size.

2. The histologic type is non-small cell carcinoma, and the grade is G3, poorly differentiated.

3. Visceral pleural invasion is negative, but tumor extension into the fissure is present.

4. The bronchial margin is negative for tumor, and vascular parenchymal parietal pleural margins are all negative for carcinoma.

5. Lymph vascular invasion is indeterminate but favors present.

6. Twelve lymph nodes, including parts A through E, are negative for carcinoma.

7. The pathologic stage is reported as nT2N0M0, which indicates a tumor size greater than 3 cm but not more than 5 cm, no nodal involvement, and no distant metastasis.

Considering the tumor size, extension into the fissure, and lymph vascular invasion, the tumor is likely to be at least Stage II. However, since there is no nodal involvement (N0), it cannot be Stage III. Therefore, the correct stage is Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
37,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the right lung, and its size is 7 cm (mentioned in the final diagnosis of the right lung, pneumonectomy).
2. The tumor has not invaded the visceral pleura (mentioned in the final diagnosis of the right lung, pneumonectomy).
3. The bronchial and vascular margins are negative (mentioned in the final diagnosis of the right lung, pneumonectomy).
4. There is no tumor seen in the lymph nodes of levels 9, 4, and 7 (mentioned in the final diagnosis of the mediastinal lymph node, level 9, right level 4 lymph node, and level 7 lymph nodes).
5. However, the tumor has metastasized to the 6th rib (mentioned in the clinical history/diagnosis: right lung cancer, and the presence of the 6th rib in the source of specimen).

Based on these findings, the tumor is classified as T2 (size > 5 cm), N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis), and M1 (distant metastasis to the 6th rib).

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a tumor with T2, N0, and M1 corresponds to Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IV""}"
38,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Primary tumor (pT): The report states that the tumor size is 3.5 cm, which corresponds to pT2a (tumor more than 3 cm but 5 cm or less).

2. Regional lymph nodes (pN): The report mentions that there are metastases in 3 of 18 lymph nodes, specifically in the ipsilateral peribronchial lymph nodes, which corresponds to pN1.

3. Distant metastases (pM): There is no mention of distant metastases in the report.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* pT2a (primary tumor) + pN1 (regional lymph nodes) = Stage IIB (according to the 7th edition AJCC staging system).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IIB""}"
