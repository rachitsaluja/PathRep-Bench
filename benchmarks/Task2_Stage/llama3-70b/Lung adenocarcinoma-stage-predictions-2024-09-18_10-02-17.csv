Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (pT)**: The report mentions two separate primary tumors, one in the lingula (1 cm) and another in the left lower lobe (3.5 cm). Both tumors are adenocarcinomas with different histological subtypes. The larger tumor (3.5 cm) is classified as pT2a, as it is greater than 3 cm but not more than 5 cm in greatest dimension.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN)**: The report states that four lymph nodes were negative for carcinoma (0/4), indicating that there is no regional lymph node metastasis. Therefore, pN is classified as pN0.

3. **Distant Metastases (pM)**: There is no mention of distant metastases in the report, so pM is classified as pM0.

Considering the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage of the cancer. Since there are two separate primary tumors, the TNM descriptors include ""m"" for multiple primary tumors. The larger tumor is classified as pT2a, and there is no regional lymph node metastasis (pN0) or distant metastasis (pM0). Therefore, the overall stage is Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage II}"
1,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor is located in the right lower lobe of the lung, and its size is 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.6 cm, which corresponds to a T2 tumor (tumor size > 2 cm but ≤ 5 cm).
2. The tumor invades the pleura, but there is no lymphovascular space invasion.
3. The surgical margin status shows that the tumor is at least 2.8 cm away from the bronchial margin and focally involves the pleural surface.
4. The lymph node status is N0, as all lymph nodes (stations 4, 7, 11, and 12) are negative for tumor.

Based on the TNM classification, the tumor is T2N0. According to the AJCC staging system, a T2N0 tumor corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
2,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Primary tumor (pT): The report states that the tumor size is 2.8 cm (greatest dimension), and it is classified as pT1b, which corresponds to a tumor larger than 2 cm but not more than 3 cm in greatest dimension.

2. Regional lymph nodes (pN): The report indicates that 1 out of 17 lymph nodes are involved (pN1). Specifically, 1 lymph node in the peribronchial region of the left lower lobe is positive for malignancy.

3. Distant metastasis (pM): The report states that the distant metastasis status is pMX, which means it cannot be assessed.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* The primary tumor is classified as pT1b, which corresponds to a T1 tumor.
* The regional lymph nodes are classified as pN1, which corresponds to an N1 tumor.
* There is no evidence of distant metastasis.

According to the AJCC staging system, a T1 tumor with N1 nodes corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
3,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The tumor size is 2.5 x 2.0 cm, which corresponds to a T1 tumor (since it is ≤ 3 cm in greatest dimension).
* Ten out of twelve lymph nodes are involved by metastatic carcinoma, including the subcarinal lymph node. This indicates that the lymph node involvement is pN2.
* There is no distant metastasis (pMX).

According to the AJCC staging system, a T1 tumor with pN2 lymph node involvement corresponds to Stage IIIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IIIA}"
4,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Primary tumor (pT): The report states that the tumor measures 2.7 cm in greatest dimension and invades the visceral pleura, which corresponds to pT2a.
2. Regional lymph nodes (pN): The report indicates that two lymph nodes were examined, and none of them showed metastatic carcinoma, which corresponds to pN0.
3. Distant metastasis (pM): There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so we can assume pM0.

According to the AJCC 7th edition staging system, a tumor with pT2a, pN0, and pM0 corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
5,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (pT)**: The report states that the tumor is 2.5 cm in greatest dimension, surrounded by lung or visceral pleura, without bronchoscopic evidence of invasion more proximal than the lobar bronchus. This corresponds to pT1b.
2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN)**: The report indicates that there is no regional lymph node metastasis (pN0).
3. **Distant Metastases (pM)**: There is no mention of distant metastases, so pM0.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage using the TNM staging system.

**Stage**: The combination of pT1b, pN0, and pM0 corresponds to **Stage I**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
6,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the right lower lobe lung and measures 5 x 4 x 3 cm, which corresponds to a T2 tumor (since it's larger than 3 cm but not more than 5 cm).
2. The bronchial margin is negative for tumor, which indicates that the tumor has not invaded the bronchus.
3. One of the six intrapulmonary peribronchial lymph nodes is positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma, which indicates N1 disease (metastasis to intrapulmonary lymph nodes).
4. The report does not mention any distant metastases (M1 disease).

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* T2 (primary tumor size)
* N1 (metastasis to intrapulmonary lymph nodes)
* M0 (no distant metastases)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2N1M0 tumor corresponds to Stage IIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IIA}"
7,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor size is 2.3 cm in greatest diameter, which corresponds to pT1b.
2. The tumor does not invade the visceral pleura, and the surgical margin status is carcinoma extends to within 1 mm of the staple line on this wedge resection.
3. There is no metastatic carcinoma identified in the lymph nodes (0/2, 0/3, 0/1).
4. The pTN stage is pT1b NO, which indicates that the tumor is 2.3 cm in size and has not spread to the lymph nodes.

Based on the above information, the AJCC stage of the cancer is Stage I, as the tumor is small (pT1b) and has not spread to the lymph nodes (NO).

Therefore, the answer is -

8,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the right upper lobe, and its size is 3.5 x 2.4 x 2.3 cm. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a tumor of this size corresponds to T2a (tumor >2 cm but ≤3 cm in greatest dimension).
2. The tumor does not grossly appear to involve the bronchus, but it is close to the bronchial margin (0.3 cm). This suggests that the tumor does not invade the bronchus, which is confirmed by the histologic assessment of surgical margins, which appear negative for carcinoma.
3. There is no pleural involvement, and the tumor does not invade the pleura.
4. Perineural invasion is present, but angiolymphatic invasion is not identified.
5. Metastatic adenocarcinoma is found in 1 of 5 hilar lymph nodes, which corresponds to N1 (metastasis in ipsilateral peribronchial and/or hilar lymph nodes).
6. There are two small pleural nodules, one 0.4 cm in diameter and the other 0.4 cm in diameter, which are satellite tumor nodules.

Considering the above findings, the tumor is classified as T2a, N1, and M0 (no distant metastases). According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, this corresponds to Stage IIA (T2a, N1, M0).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IIA}"
9,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions a left lower lobectomy with a tumor measuring 50 x 60 x 45 mm, which involves the posterior lateral basal and anterior basal segments. This indicates a significant tumor size, but no specific T stage is mentioned.

2. The tumor appears to surround a major segmental bronchus and extends close to the bronchial resection margin, but the medial margin is not involved. This suggests that the tumor is likely T2, as it has not invaded the mediastinum or surrounding structures.

3. The report mentions that the tumor probably does not involve the pleura, and this is confirmed by special stains in the addendum report. This rules out T3 or T4 staging.

4. The hilar lymph node is negative for metastatic malignancy, indicating N0 staging.

5. There is no mention of distant metastases (M1), and the report specifically states ""Mx"" (unknown metastatic status), which is often used when there is no evidence of metastases.

Based on these findings, the tumor is classified as T2N0Mx. According to the AJCC staging system, this corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
10,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Tumor size**: The tumor size is 3 x 3 x 3 cm, which is a significant factor in determining the T stage. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a tumor of this size corresponds to a T2 stage (tumors > 3 cm in greatest dimension).

2. **Tumor extent**: The tumor extends to the visceral pleura, which indicates a T2 stage as well.

3. **Lymph nodes**: One out of one lymph node is positive for metastasis, which is an N1 stage (metastasis to intrathoracic lymph nodes).

4. **Distant metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so we can assume M0 (no distant metastasis).

Now, let's combine the T, N, and M stages to determine the overall stage. With a T2 stage, N1 stage, and M0 stage, the patient's cancer corresponds to **Stage III** according to the AJCC 8th edition staging system.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
11,"## Answer

14,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

The primary tumor (T) is described as a 4 cm adenocarcinoma, acinar type, grade III, invading the visceral pleura. This corresponds to a pT2 tumor.

The lymph nodes (N) are involved, with metastatic adenocarcinoma found in two of four lymph nodes (2/4) in the right lower lobe and one of five lymph nodes (1/5) in the level 7 lymph node. This corresponds to a pN2 lymph node status.

There is no mention of distant metastases (M) in the report, so the M status is unknown (Mx).

According to the AJCC staging system, a pT2 tumor with pN2 lymph node status and unknown M status corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
15,"## Answer

1. **Primary tumor (T)**: The report mentions an ""invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma"" in the right lung, measuring 9.2 cm in greatest dimension, invading into the chest wall (pT3).
2. **Lymph node involvement (N)**: The report states that 19 peribronchial lymph nodes are negative for carcinoma (0/19), and 6 lymph nodes from levels 1-9 are also negative (0/6). However, the tumor is classified as N1, indicating ipsilateral hilar and/or peribronchial lymph node involvement (levels 10-14).
3. **Distant metastasis (M)**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so we can assume Mx (unknown) or M0 (no distant metastasis).

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* T3 (primary tumor size > 5 cm and invading into the chest wall)
* N1 (ipsilateral hilar and/or peribronchial lymph node involvement)
* Mx or M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 7th Edition, the stage corresponding to T3N1Mx/M0 is **Stage III**.

* T2 (tumor size > 3 cm) and N0 (no lymph node involvement) correspond to Stage I or Stage II.
* Since there is no mention of distant metastasis, we can rule out Stage IV.
* The absence of lymph node involvement and the tumor size being > 3 cm but not > 5 cm (which would correspond to T3) suggest that the stage is likely Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
31,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor site is the upper lobe of the right lung, and the tumor size is 3.7 cm, 2.9 x 2.8 cm, and 1.2 cm x 0.8 cm x 0.7 cm, indicating a T3 tumor (since it's larger than 3 cm).
2. The visceral pleural invasion is not identified, and the tumor extension is not identified, which means there is no invasion into the visceral pleura or other structures.
3. The margins are uninvolved by invasive carcinoma, and the distance of invasive carcinoma from the closest margin is 3.4 cm.
4. Lymph nodes are negative for malignancy (0/11), which means N0.
5. There is no mention of distant metastases, so M0.

Based on the TNM classification, the patient has a T3N0M0 tumor, which corresponds to Stage IIB according to the AJCC 8th edition staging system.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IIB""}"
32,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (T)**: The tumor size is 3.5 cm, which corresponds to T2 (Tumor greater than 3 cm in greatest dimension).
2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N)**: Metastases are present in ipsilateral peribronchial and ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes, which corresponds to N1 (Metastases in ipsilateral peribronchial and ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes).
3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: There is no evidence of distant metastasis, so M is MX (Cannot be assessed).
4. **Margins**: The margins are uninvolved by invasive carcinoma, and the distance of invasive tumor from the closest margin is 5 mm.
5. **Direct Extension of Tumor**: The tumor has extended to the visceral pleura.
6. **Lymphovascular Invasion**: There is evidence of venous, arterial, and lymphatic invasion.

Based on these findings, the AJCC stage can be determined as follows:

* T2 (Primary Tumor)
* N1 (Regional Lymph Nodes)
* MX (Distant Metastasis)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, the stage corresponding to T2N1MX is Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
33,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Primary tumor (pT): The primary tumor measures 2.5 cm in greatest dimensions, and there is a suggestion of visceral pleural invasion. This corresponds to a pT2a tumor.

2. Regional lymph nodes (pN): The level 12 lymph nodes demonstrate evidence of metastasis, which means that the cancer has spread to the regional lymph nodes. This corresponds to a pN2 tumor.

3. Distant metastasis (pM): There is no evidence of distant metastasis in this specimen, so pM is unknown (pMX).

Based on the AJCC staging system, a pT2a tumor with pN2 lymph nodes corresponds to Stage IIIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IIIA""}"
34,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Primary tumor (pT): The tumor measures 3.5 cm in maximum dimension and invades into the pleura, which corresponds to pT2.

2. Regional lymph nodes (pN): The report states pNX, which means the lymph nodes were not assessed.

3. Distant metastasis (pM): The report states pMX, which means distant metastasis was not assessed.

Based on the information provided, we can determine the T stage as T2 (tumor size > 3 cm and invades the pleura). Since the lymph nodes and distant metastasis were not assessed, we cannot determine the N and M stages.

However, since the tumor invades the pleura, it is likely that the tumor has spread to the pleura, which would correspond to a minimum of Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
35,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions ""Pathologic stage is T2N0MX"". This indicates that the tumor is classified as T2 (tumor size is between 2-5 cm), N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis), and MX (distant metastasis cannot be assessed).

2. The tumor size is 2.8 cm, which falls within the T2 category.

3. There is no regional lymph node metastasis (N0), as all sampled lymph nodes are benign.

4. There is no mention of distant metastasis, so MX is appropriate.

5. The report also mentions angiolymphatic and visceral pleural invasion, which is a feature of the primary tumor and does not affect the N or M classification.

Based on the TNM classification, the patient has a T2N0MX tumor, which corresponds to Stage IIA according to the AJCC 8th edition staging system.

However, since Stage IIA is not an option, we need to consider the closest match. Stage I includes T1 and T2 tumors with N0 and M0, which matches the patient's tumor characteristics.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
36,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor site is in the middle lobe of the right lung, and the maximum tumor size is 5.5 x 5.0 cm, which is a significant size.

2. The histologic type is non-small cell carcinoma, and the grade is G3, poorly differentiated.

3. Visceral pleural invasion is negative, but tumor extension into the fissure is present.

4. The bronchial margin is negative for tumor, and vascular parenchymal parietal pleural margins are all negative for carcinoma.

5. Lymph vascular invasion is indeterminate but favors present.

6. Twelve lymph nodes, including parts A through E, are negative for carcinoma.

7. The pathologic stage is reported as nT2N0M0, which indicates a tumor size greater than 3 cm but not more than 5 cm, no nodal involvement, and no distant metastasis.

Considering the tumor size, extension into the fissure, and lymph vascular invasion, the tumor is likely to be at least Stage II. However, since there is no nodal involvement (N0), it cannot be Stage III. Therefore, the correct stage is Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
37,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the right lung, and its size is 7 cm (mentioned in the final diagnosis of the right lung, pneumonectomy).
2. The tumor has not invaded the visceral pleura (mentioned in the final diagnosis of the right lung, pneumonectomy).
3. The bronchial and vascular margins are negative (mentioned in the final diagnosis of the right lung, pneumonectomy).
4. There is no tumor seen in the lymph nodes of levels 9, 4, and 7 (mentioned in the final diagnosis of the mediastinal lymph node, level 9, right level 4 lymph node, and level 7 lymph nodes).
5. However, the tumor has metastasized to the 6th rib (mentioned in the clinical history/diagnosis: right lung cancer, and the presence of the 6th rib in the source of specimen).

Based on these findings, the tumor is classified as T2 (size > 5 cm), N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis), and M1 (distant metastasis to the 6th rib).

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a tumor with T2, N0, and M1 corresponds to Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IV""}"
38,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Primary tumor (pT): The report states that the tumor size is 3.5 cm, which corresponds to pT2a (tumor more than 3 cm but 5 cm or less).

2. Regional lymph nodes (pN): The report indicates that there are metastases in 3 of 18 lymph nodes, which corresponds to pN1 (metastasis in ipsilateral peribronchial lymph nodes).

3. Distant metastasis (pM): There is no mention of distant metastases in the report.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* pT2a (primary tumor) + pN1 (regional lymph nodes) = Stage IIB (according to the 7th edition AJCC staging system).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IIB""}"
