2. **Invasion**: The tumor is noted to extend into the duodenal wall, which suggests a more advanced stage of disease. Invasive characteristics typically correlate with a poorer prognosis.

3. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report states that one out of nine examined lymph nodes showed metastatic carcinoma. Lymph node involvement is a critical factor in staging and prognosis, indicating that the cancer has spread beyond the primary site.

4. **Staging**: The pTNM stage is reported as pT3 N1. This indicates that the tumor is locally advanced (T3) and has regional lymph node involvement (N1). Generally, a pT3 N1 stage suggests a more aggressive disease with a higher risk of recurrence and lower survival rates.

Considering these factors, the presence of invasive adenocarcinoma, the size of the tumor, the invasion into surrounding structures, and the lymph node involvement all suggest a poor prognosis. Therefore, it is likely that the patient may not survive after 1.59 years.

Final answer: 
{""Survival"": ""False""}"
