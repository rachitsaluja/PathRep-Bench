To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to consider the TNM classification provided in the pathology report:

1. **Primary Tumor (T):** The report indicates ""pT4a"". According to AJCC, T4a indicates a moderately advanced local disease where the tumor invades through the thyroid cartilage and/or invades tissues beyond the larynx (e.g., trachea, soft tissues of neck, deep/extrinsic muscle of tongue, strap muscles, thyroid, or esophagus).

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):** The report indicates ""pN2c"". N2c means metastasis in bilateral or contralateral lymph nodes, none more than 6 cm in greatest dimension.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** The report indicates ""pMx"", which means distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Given the TNM classification:
- T4a indicates a locally advanced tumor.
- N2c indicates significant regional lymph node involvement.
- Mx indicates that distant metastasis cannot be assessed, but for staging purposes, we assume no distant metastasis unless proven otherwise.

According to the AJCC staging system for laryngeal cancer:
- Stage IV is divided into IVA, IVB, and IVC. 
- Stage IVA includes T4a, N0-N2, M0, which matches the classification given (T4a, N2c, Mx).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IV""}"
1,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer from the pathology report, we need to consider the following key elements:

1. **Tumor Size and Local Invasion (T):**
   - The report describes an ""invasive poorly differentiated squamous carcinoma"" involving the anterior mandible and floor of the mouth.
   - There is mention of ""lymphatic and perineural invasion"" and the tumor being ""close to margin of resection.""
   - The tumor invades the bone, which is significant for staging.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N):**
   - The report states ""five lymph nodes, no tumor,"" indicating no regional lymph node metastasis.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):**
   - There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report.

Based on the AJCC staging system for oral cavity cancers:
- **T4a**: Moderately advanced local disease, such as invasion into the cortical bone, which is consistent with the tumor invading the mandible.
- **N0**: No regional lymph node metastasis.
- **M0**: No distant metastasis.

Given these findings, the cancer would be classified as Stage IVa due to the T4a classification (invasion into the bone) despite the absence of lymph node involvement or distant metastasis.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IV""}"
2,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to consider the T (tumor size and extent), N (regional lymph node involvement), and M (distant metastasis) categories from the pathology report.

1. **Primary Tumor (pT):** The report states ""Tumor more than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension."" According to AJCC, this corresponds to pT2.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN):** The report indicates ""pN2b: Metastasis in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes, none more than 6 cm in greatest dimension."" This corresponds to pN2b, which involves metastasis in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes.

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM):** The report states ""pMX: cannot be assessed."" This means there is no information on distant metastasis, but for staging purposes, we assume no distant metastasis unless specified otherwise.

Given these findings:
- **T2**: Tumor size more than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm.
- **N2b**: Metastasis in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes.
- **M0**: No distant metastasis (assumed due to pMX).

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system for oral cavity cancers:
- Stage I: T1, N0, M0
- Stage II: T2, N0, M0
- Stage III: T3, N0, M0 or T1-T3, N1, M0
- Stage IV: Any T, N2 or N3, M0 or any T, any N, M1

The presence of N2b (multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes involved) automatically classifies this as Stage IV, regardless of the T category, as long as there is no distant metastasis (M0).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IV""}"
3,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information:

1. **Tumor Size and Extent**: The invasive keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma is 1.9 cm in size, which falls under the T1 category (tumor â‰¤ 2 cm in greatest dimension).

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: There is no lymph node involvement as all 24 lymph nodes examined are negative for carcinoma (N0).

3. **Distant Metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis, which would be classified as M0.

4. **AJCC Pathologic Stage**: The report explicitly states the pathologic stage as pT1 pN0, which corresponds to Stage I according to the AJCC staging system for oral cavity cancers.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
4,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging the cancer according to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) guidelines:

1. **Primary Tumor (pT):** The tumor is classified as pT2, which indicates a tumor more than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN):** The classification is pN0, meaning there is no regional lymph node metastasis. A total of 27 lymph nodes were examined, and none were involved.

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM):** The report states ""Not applicable,"" which typically implies that there is no evidence of distant metastasis.

Based on the AJCC staging system for oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma:

- **Stage I:** pT1, pN0, M0
- **Stage II:** pT2, pN0, M0
- **Stage III:** pT3 or pN1, M0
- **Stage IV:** pT4 or any T with pN2/pN3 or M1

Given the information:
- The tumor is pT2.
- There is no lymph node involvement (pN0).
- There is no distant metastasis (M0).

This corresponds to **Stage II** cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
5,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to consider the TNM classification provided in the pathology report:

1. **Tumor Size and Extent (T):** The report indicates ""pT2"". According to AJCC staging for laryngeal cancer, T2 indicates a tumor that invades the mucosa of more than one adjacent subsite of the supraglottis, glottis, or subglottis, or a tumor with impaired vocal cord mobility.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):** The report states ""pNO (Delphian)"", which means there is no regional lymph node metastasis.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, which implies M0.

Given the TNM classification of T2 N0 M0, we can determine the stage:

- **Stage I:** T1 N0 M0
- **Stage II:** T2 N0 M0
- **Stage III:** T3 N0 M0 or T1-3 N1 M0
- **Stage IV:** T4a/b N0-3 M0 or any T N2-3 M0 or any T any N M1

The classification T2 N0 M0 corresponds to **Stage II** for laryngeal cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
6,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to consider the T (tumor), N (nodes), and M (metastasis) classification based on the provided pathology report.

1. **Tumor (T) Classification:**
   - The tumor is described as invasive poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma involving the supraglottis, left piriform sinus, and extending to the epiglottis, false and true vocal cords.
   - Tumor size is 5.0 x 3.0 cm.
   - The tumor invades the anterior space and involves the thyroid and epiglottic cartilage with extension to the soft tissues, indicating extensive perineural invasion.
   - These findings suggest at least a T3 classification due to invasion of the thyroid cartilage and soft tissues.

2. **Nodes (N) Classification:**
   - Left modified radical neck dissection shows 5 out of 42 positive lymph nodes with macrometastasis, the largest metastatic focus being 2.2 cm.
   - No extracapsular extension is present.
   - Positive nodes are found in levels 2, 3, and 4.
   - This indicates at least an N2 classification due to multiple positive lymph nodes on one side of the neck.

3. **Metastasis (M) Classification:**
   - There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so we assume M0.

Based on the above analysis:
- The tumor is at least T3 due to cartilage invasion.
- The nodal involvement is at least N2 due to multiple positive nodes.
- No distant metastasis is noted, so M0.

According to the AJCC staging system for laryngeal cancer, a combination of T3, N2, and M0 corresponds to Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IV""}"
7,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to consider the following components from the pathology report: tumor size, lymph node involvement, and metastasis.

1. **Tumor Size and Extent**: The tumor is 4 x 2 cm and involves the deep muscles of the tongue. This suggests a T classification of at least T2 or T3, depending on the specific criteria for laryngeal cancer staging.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: There is 1 out of 4 cervical lymph nodes positive for metastasis. This indicates N1 classification, as there is regional lymph node involvement.

3. **Distant Metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis, so we assume M0.

Based on these details:
- The tumor size and involvement of deep muscles suggest a T2 or T3 classification.
- The presence of metastasis in one cervical lymph node suggests N1.
- No distant metastasis suggests M0.

According to the AJCC staging system for laryngeal cancer:
- Stage III can be characterized by T1-T3, N1, M0.
- Stage IV is typically characterized by more extensive local invasion (T4), multiple lymph node involvement (N2 or N3), or distant metastasis (M1).

Given the information, the most appropriate stage is Stage III, as it fits the criteria of T1-T3, N1, M0.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
8,"## Answer
The pathology report provides detailed information about the tumor and lymph node involvement:

1. **Primary Tumor (T):** The tumor is described as squamous cell carcinoma, moderately differentiated, with a maximum diameter of 5.5 cm. According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor more than 4 cm in greatest dimension in the oral cavity is classified as T3.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):** The report indicates metastatic squamous cell carcinoma involving lymph nodes on both sides of the neck (bilateral involvement). Specifically, six out of thirty-five lymph nodes on the left and two out of twenty-one lymph nodes on the right are involved. The largest involved lymph node measures 3.1 cm, and extranodal invasion is present on the left side. The pathologic staging is given as pN2c, which indicates metastasis in bilateral or contralateral lymph nodes, none more than 6 cm in greatest dimension.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** The report states pMX, meaning distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Based on the AJCC staging system:
- T3 indicates a larger primary tumor.
- N2c indicates significant lymph node involvement, specifically bilateral or contralateral lymph node metastasis.
- The presence of extranodal extension further suggests advanced nodal disease.

Given these factors, the cancer is classified as Stage IV, as Stage IV includes T1-3, N2c, M0 (no distant metastasis assessed but significant nodal involvement).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IV""}"
9,"## Answer
The pathology report indicates the presence of metastatic squamous carcinoma in multiple lymph nodes on both sides of the neck, specifically:

- Right neck dissection: Metastatic carcinoma in 1 of 10 right level III lymph nodes.
- Left neck dissection: Metastatic carcinoma in 3 of 6 left level II lymph nodes, 2 of 9 left level III lymph nodes, and 3 of 4 left level IV lymph nodes.

The primary tumor is a poorly differentiated non-keratinizing squamous carcinoma located in the right pyriform sinus, measuring 3.5 x 1.5 x 1.1 cm, involving the lateral wall of the larynx without bone invasion. The margins of resection are free of tumor.

According to the AJCC staging system for head and neck cancers, the presence of metastatic carcinoma in multiple lymph nodes, particularly on both sides of the neck, suggests advanced nodal involvement. The tumor size and lack of bone invasion suggest a T2 classification. However, the extensive nodal involvement, especially with multiple positive nodes on both sides, indicates N2 or N3 classification.

Given the bilateral nodal involvement and the number of affected nodes, this would likely correspond to Stage IV cancer, which is characterized by advanced local and/or regional disease.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IV""}"
10,"## Answer
The pathology report indicates the presence of invasive moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the pharynx with a maximum dimension of 4.5 cm. There is lymphovascular invasion and metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in cervical lymph nodes. Specifically, there is metastatic involvement in 1 of 10 right cervical lymph nodes and 5 of 10 left cervical lymph nodes. The presence of metastatic carcinoma in multiple lymph nodes, particularly on both sides of the neck, suggests a more advanced stage.

According to the AJCC staging system for head and neck cancers, including the pharynx, the involvement of multiple lymph nodes, especially when they are on both sides of the neck, typically indicates Stage IV disease. Stage IV is characterized by extensive local invasion, large primary tumors, or significant lymph node involvement.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IV""}"
11,"## Answer
The pathology report provides detailed information about the tumor and lymph node involvement, which are critical for determining the AJCC stage of cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (T):** The report indicates a squamous cell carcinoma with a greatest dimension of 5.0 cm. It infiltrates salivary glands and skeletal muscle, including the tongue. The carcinoma is extensively present at the surgical margins, indicating significant local invasion. According to AJCC staging, this corresponds to T4a, which is defined as a tumor that invades through the larynx, extrinsic muscle of the tongue, medial pterygoid, hard palate, or mandible.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):** The report states metastatic carcinoma is present in four of 35 lymph nodes: 1/8 level IIA, 2/8 level III, and 1/5 level IV. The largest positive node is 2.5 cm, and there is extracapsular extension in the level IIA and III nodes. According to AJCC staging, N2b is defined as metastasis in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes, none more than 6 cm in greatest dimension.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** The report does not provide information on distant metastasis (MX), which means it cannot be assessed.

Given the information:
- T4a: Tumor invades through the larynx, extrinsic muscle of the tongue, medial pterygoid, hard palate, or mandible.
- N2b: Metastasis in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes, none more than 6 cm in greatest dimension.
- MX: Distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

According to the AJCC 7th edition staging system, a combination of T4a and N2b corresponds to Stage IVa.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IV""}"
12,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key details:

1. **Tumor Type and Grade**: The tumor is a well-differentiated keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx.

2. **Tumor Size**: The tumor measures 1 x 0 x 1.5 cm.

3. **Tumor Extent**: The tumor is described as localized, with involvement of all parts of the larynx as seen in endoscopies and figrolaryngoscopy.

4. **Margins**: The surgical margins are uninvolved, indicating that the tumor has not spread beyond the larynx.

5. **Venous Invasion**: There is no venous invasion.

6. **Lymph Nodes**: Lymph node involvement is not specified in the report.

7. **Distant Metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis.

Based on the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for laryngeal cancer, the stage is determined by the T (tumor size and extent), N (regional lymph node involvement), and M (distant metastasis) categories.

- **T Category**: The tumor involves all parts of the larynx but is localized, suggesting a T3 classification, as T3 typically involves a tumor that is limited to the larynx with vocal cord fixation or invasion of the paraglottic space.

- **N Category**: Lymph node involvement is not specified, which typically defaults to N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis).

- **M Category**: There is no mention of distant metastasis, suggesting M0.

Given the involvement of all parts of the larynx and the absence of lymph node involvement or distant metastasis, the most appropriate stage based on the information provided would be Stage III, which corresponds to T3 N0 M0.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
13,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to consider the TNM classification provided in the pathology report:

1. **Primary Tumor (T):** The report states ""pT2: Tumor invades the mucosa of region outside the supraglottis."" According to AJCC, T2 for laryngeal cancer indicates a tumor that invades the mucosa of more than one adjacent region of the larynx (e.g., supraglottis and glottis) without fixation of the larynx.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):** The report indicates ""pN2c: Metastasis in bilateral lymph nodes, none more than 6 cm in greatest dimension."" According to AJCC, N2c indicates metastasis in bilateral lymph nodes, none more than 6 cm in greatest dimension.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** There is no mention of distant metastasis (M0), which is typical unless specified otherwise.

Combining these, the TNM classification is T2 N2c M0. According to the AJCC staging system for laryngeal cancer:

- **Stage I:** T1 N0 M0
- **Stage II:** T2 N0 M0
- **Stage III:** T3 N0 M0 or T1-3 N1 M0
- **Stage IV:** Any T N2 M0 or any T N3 M0 or any T any N M1

Given the classification T2 N2c M0, this corresponds to Stage IV because of the N2c classification.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IV""}"
14,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging the cancer according to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) guidelines:

1. **Primary Tumor (pT):** The report states ""pT4a,"" which indicates that the tumor has invaded through the cortical bone, into the deep (extrinsic) muscles of the tongue, maxillary sinus, or skin of the face. This is a characteristic of a T4a classification.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN):** The report states ""pN0,"" meaning there is no regional lymph node metastasis. A total of 45 lymph nodes were examined, and none were found to have tumor involvement.

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM):** The report states ""pMX,"" which means that distant metastasis cannot be assessed. However, for staging purposes, if there is no evidence of distant metastasis, it is often considered as M0.

Given these details:
- The tumor is classified as T4a due to its invasion into the skin.
- There is no lymph node involvement (N0).
- Distant metastasis is not assessed (MX), but typically considered M0 if not specified otherwise.

According to the AJCC staging system for oral cavity cancers:
- **Stage IV** can be subdivided into IVA, IVB, and IVC. Stage IVA includes T4a, N0, M0, which matches the findings in this report.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IV""}"
15,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging:

1. **Primary Tumor (pT):** The tumor is classified as pT4b. According to the AJCC staging system, T4b indicates a very advanced local disease where the tumor has invaded deeper structures such as the pterygoid plates, skull base, or encases the carotid artery.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN):** The report states pN0, meaning no regional lymph node metastasis was found. A total of 59 lymph nodes were examined, and none were involved.

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM):** The report lists pMX, indicating that distant metastasis cannot be assessed. However, the absence of distant metastasis is typically assumed unless otherwise specified.

Given the T4b classification, the cancer is considered very advanced locally. In the AJCC staging system for head and neck cancers, a T4b classification typically corresponds to Stage IV, regardless of lymph node involvement or distant metastasis, due to the extent of local invasion.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IV""}"
16,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging:

1. **Primary Tumor (T):** The tumor is described as squamous cell carcinoma, moderately differentiated, with a maximum diameter of 4.4 cm and a thickness of 2.6 cm. The tumor is present at the deep margin, indicating it is not fully resected. According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor in the oral cavity that is more than 4 cm in greatest dimension is classified as T3.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):** There is metastasis in one lymph node in the left neck level I, measuring 1.6 cm, with extranodal extension. This corresponds to N1, which is defined as metastasis in a single ipsilateral lymph node, 3 cm or less in greatest dimension.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** The report states pMX, meaning distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Based on the AJCC 8th edition staging system for oral cavity cancers:
- **Stage III** is defined as T3 N0 M0 or T1-3 N1 M0.

In this case, the patient has T3 N1 M0, which corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
17,"## Answer
The pathology report indicates the presence of invasive squamous cell carcinoma in the larynx, specifically in the right and left aryepiglottic folds. The report mentions that the carcinoma is moderately differentiated and extends into adjacent cartilage. 

In the AJCC staging system for laryngeal cancer, the involvement of cartilage and the presence of tumors in both aryepiglottic folds suggest a more advanced stage. Typically, extension into cartilage and involvement of multiple sites within the larynx would indicate a higher stage, such as Stage III or Stage IV.

Stage I and Stage II are generally characterized by smaller tumors confined to a single site without cartilage invasion or significant spread. Stage III often involves larger tumors or limited regional spread, while Stage IV indicates more extensive local invasion, such as cartilage involvement, or distant metastasis.

Given the information about cartilage invasion and bilateral involvement, the most appropriate stage for this cancer is likely Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IV""}"
18,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information:

1. **Tumor Size and Invasion**: The tumor is a moderately differentiated endophytic squamous cell carcinoma, measuring 1 cm in diameter and invasive to a depth of 0.5 cm.

2. **Margins**: The final margins of resection are free of tumor involvement, indicating that the tumor has been completely excised.

3. **Lymphatic Invasion**: There is no angiolymphatic invasion identified.

4. **Lymph Nodes**: Sentinel lymph nodes and additional lymph nodes (total of four) were examined, and no metastatic squamous cell carcinoma was identified in any of them.

5. **AJCC Pathologic Stage**: The report explicitly states the AJCC pathologic stage as T1, N0.

Based on the AJCC staging system for oral cavity cancers, a T1 classification indicates a tumor that is 2 cm or less in greatest dimension. N0 indicates no regional lymph node metastasis. 

The combination of T1 and N0 corresponds to Stage I cancer according to the AJCC staging criteria.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
19,"## Answer
The pathology report provides detailed information about the cancer diagnosis and staging. Let's break down the key points:

1. **Primary Tumor (pT):** The tumor is described as invasive squamous cell carcinoma, moderately to poorly differentiated, with a size of 3.5 cm. The report specifies the primary tumor stage as pT2. According to AJCC staging, pT2 indicates a tumor size greater than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN):** The report indicates that 1 out of 33 lymph nodes is involved by squamous cell carcinoma, with the largest focus measuring 2.4 cm, and there is no extracapsular extension. The lymph node stage is pN1, which typically means metastasis in a single ipsilateral lymph node, 3 cm or less in greatest dimension.

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM):** There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, which implies pM0 (no distant metastasis).

4. **Final Pathologic Stage:** The report explicitly states that the findings correspond to AJCC Edition pathologic Stage III (pT2, pN1, pMn/a).

Based on the provided information, the cancer is staged as Stage III according to the AJCC staging system. The combination of pT2 (tumor size), pN1 (lymph node involvement), and the absence of distant metastasis aligns with Stage III criteria.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
20,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging:

1. **Primary Tumor (pT):** The tumor is classified as pT2, which indicates a tumor more than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN):** There is metastatic carcinoma in one of the three lymph nodes examined at Level I, with extranodal extension present. This corresponds to pN2b, which involves metastasis in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes, none more than 6 cm in greatest dimension, or metastasis in any single ipsilateral lymph node more than 3 cm but not more than 6 cm in greatest dimension.

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM):** There is no mention of distant metastasis, so it is considered pM0.

Based on the AJCC staging system for head and neck cancers, the presence of a pT2 tumor with pN2b lymph node involvement and no distant metastasis (pM0) corresponds to Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IV""}"
21,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information:

1. **Tumor Characteristics**: The tumor is a squamous cell carcinoma, moderately differentiated, with a size of 3.8 cm. It is described as invasive transglottic, invading through the thyroid cartilage and into anterior soft tissue.

2. **T Stage**: The pathologic T stage is pT4a. According to the AJCC staging system, T4a indicates a tumor that invades through the thyroid cartilage and/or invades tissues beyond the larynx (e.g., trachea, soft tissues of the neck, deep/extrinsic muscle of the tongue, strap muscles, thyroid, or esophagus).

3. **N Stage**: The pathologic N stage is pN0, indicating no regional lymph node metastasis. A total of 55 lymph nodes were examined, and none were positive for tumor involvement.

4. **M Stage**: The pathologic M stage is pMX, meaning distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

5. **Overall Stage**: The combination of T4a, N0, and MX typically corresponds to Stage IVa in the AJCC staging system for laryngeal cancer. Stage IVa is characterized by moderately advanced local disease without regional lymph node involvement or distant metastasis.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IV""}"
22,"## Answer
The pathology report indicates the following key findings:

1. **Tumor Size and Invasion**: The tumor is 3 cm in largest dimension with a depth of invasion of 1.5 cm. This suggests a T2 classification according to AJCC staging for oral cavity cancers, where T2 is defined as a tumor more than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report mentions that multiple lymph nodes from different levels (I, II, III) were examined, and all were negative for tumor involvement. This indicates N0 classification, meaning no regional lymph node metastasis.

3. **Distant Metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, which implies M0 classification.

Based on the TNM classification:
- T2 (tumor size and invasion)
- N0 (no lymph node involvement)
- M0 (no distant metastasis)

The combination of T2, N0, M0 corresponds to Stage II cancer according to the AJCC staging system for oral cavity cancers.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
23,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following information:

1. **Tumor (T) Classification**: The report states ""pT4a"", which indicates that the primary tumor has grown into nearby structures such as the mandible (jawbone) or the skin of the face. This is consistent with T4a classification.

2. **Node (N) Classification**: The report states ""pNO"", which means there is no regional lymph node metastasis. This corresponds to N0 classification.

3. **Metastasis (M) Classification**: The clinical diagnosis mentions ""M0"", indicating no distant metastasis.

According to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for oral cavity cancers:

- **Stage I**: T1, N0, M0
- **Stage II**: T2, N0, M0
- **Stage III**: T3, N0, M0 or T1-T3, N1, M0
- **Stage IV**: T4a or T4b, any N, M0 or any T, N2 or N3, M0 or any T, any N, M1

Given the classifications:
- T4a (indicating advanced local disease)
- N0 (no regional lymph node involvement)
- M0 (no distant metastasis)

The presence of T4a automatically places the cancer in Stage IV, regardless of the N and M classifications, as per the AJCC guidelines.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IV""}"
24,"## Answer
The pathology report indicates the presence of invasive squamous carcinoma in the mandible floor of the mouth and tongue, with a tumor size of 2.5 cm in the largest dimension and a depth of invasion of 1.5 cm. The tumor is moderately differentiated and shows extensive perineural invasion, but no vascular invasion. Importantly, the report notes that the carcinoma invades the bone, although the bone margins are negative for carcinoma. 

The lymph node analysis shows that all examined lymph nodes are negative for tumor involvement (0/2, 0/1, etc.), indicating no regional lymph node metastasis (N0). 

According to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for oral cavity cancers, the presence of bone invasion typically indicates a more advanced stage. Specifically, bone invasion is a criterion for T4a classification, which is part of Stage IV when combined with N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis) and M0 (no distant metastasis, which is not mentioned in the report but assumed absent).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IV""}"
25,"## Answer
The pathology report describes a moderately differentiated squamous carcinoma of the right tongue and mandible. The tumor invades the mandible bone and extends beyond the gingival-buccal sulcus to the subcutaneous tissue and deep dermis of the overlying skin. The tumor measures 5.0 x 3.8 x 3.0 cm. Importantly, the resection margins are free of tumor, and there is no lymphovascular or perineural invasion identified. Additionally, there is no evidence of metastatic disease in the lymph nodes examined (22 lymph nodes from the right neck dissection and 2 from the left submandibular region).

According to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for oral cavity cancers, the following criteria are considered:
- T (Tumor size and extent): The tumor is greater than 4 cm and invades adjacent structures such as the mandible, which suggests at least T4a.
- N (Regional lymph nodes): No regional lymph node metastasis is found (N0).
- M (Distant metastasis): No distant metastasis is mentioned (M0).

Given the tumor's size and invasion into the mandible, it is classified as T4a. With N0 and M0, the overall stage is determined by the T classification. For oral cavity cancers, T4a N0 M0 corresponds to Stage IVA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IV""}"

1. **Primary Tumor (T):** The tumor is a deeply invasive squamous carcinoma, moderately differentiated, measuring 2.8 cm. The surgical margins are free of tumor, and there is no perineural or lymphovascular invasion. The tumor size and lack of invasion suggest a T2 classification (tumor more than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension).

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):** The report indicates that there is a microscopic focus of carcinoma in one of sixteen lymph nodes at Level III of the left supraomohyoid neck dissection. This indicates N1 classification (metastasis in a single ipsilateral lymph node, 3 cm or less in greatest dimension).

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, suggesting M0 classification (no distant metastasis).

Based on the AJCC staging system for oral cavity cancers, the combination of T2, N1, and M0 corresponds to Stage III cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"

The pathology report provides detailed information about the cancer diagnosis and staging. The key findings are:

1. The primary tumor is a well-differentiated invasive squamous cell carcinoma located on the tongue, measuring 1.5 cm in greatest extent.
2. The tumor is classified as pT1, indicating a small tumor size (â‰¤2 cm) without invasion into adjacent structures.
3. There is no lymphovascular invasion or perineural invasion.
4. All margins are negative for malignancy, indicating complete excision of the tumor.
5. A total of 19 lymph nodes were examined, and all were negative for malignancy (pN0).
6. There is no evidence of distant metastasis (M0), although this is not explicitly stated, it is implied by the absence of any mention of metastasis.

According to the AJCC 6th edition staging criteria, a pT1N0M0 classification corresponds to Stage I cancer. The report explicitly states that these findings correspond to AJCC 6th edition pathologic stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"

The pathology report provides detailed information about the laryngeal cancer, including the tumor's size, location, and extent of spread. Let's break down the key elements:

1. **Tumor Size and Location**: The tumor is described as invasive squamous cell carcinoma, keratinizing type, moderately differentiated, with a size of 2.1 cm. It is located in the left and right supraglottis with transglottic extension to the left and right true vocal cords. There is also involvement of the pre-epiglottic and paraglottic spaces with thyroid cartilage invasion.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report indicates micrometastatic squamous cell carcinoma in one of twenty-five lymph nodes on the left side and metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in two of fourteen lymph nodes on the right side. There is no extracapsular spread.

3. **Pathologic Stage**: The report explicitly states the pathologic stage as pT4, N2c. 

   - **T4**: This indicates that the tumor has invaded through the thyroid cartilage and/or has extended to other structures beyond the larynx, such as the pre-epiglottic space.
   - **N2c**: This indicates metastasis in lymph nodes on both sides of the neck, but without extracapsular spread.

4. **M Stage**: The report lists pMX, meaning that distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

According to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for laryngeal cancer:

- **Stage IV** is characterized by T4 tumors, which have invaded through the thyroid cartilage or beyond, and/or N2c lymph node involvement, which includes metastasis to lymph nodes on both sides of the neck.

Therefore, based on the T4 and N2c classification, the cancer is classified as Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IV""}"
29,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to consider the primary tumor (T), regional lymph nodes (N), and distant metastasis (M) based on the provided pathology report.

1. **Primary Tumor (T):**
   - The tumor is located in the larynx and is described as squamous cell carcinoma, grade 2, with a keratinizing pattern.
   - The tumor size is 5.5 cm.
   - There is invasion into the mucosa, cartilage, and skeletal muscle.
   - Lymphatic invasion is present, but vascular invasion is not detected.
   - Based on the size (>4 cm) and invasion into cartilage and muscle, this would likely be classified as T3 or T4 depending on the extent of invasion into surrounding structures.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):**
   - There is metastasis in two lymph nodes without capsular involvement among eleven lymph nodes (2/11).
   - There is also mention of squamous cell carcinoma metastasis in one lymph node with capsular involvement.
   - This suggests N2, as there is metastasis in multiple lymph nodes.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):**
   - There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so we assume M0.

Based on the above information, the likely staging would be T3 or T4, N2, M0. In the AJCC staging system for laryngeal cancer, this would correspond to Stage III or Stage IV, depending on the exact T classification. However, given the lymph node involvement and the size/invasion of the tumor, Stage IV is more likely.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IV""}"
30,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging:

1. **Primary Tumor (T):** The tumor is described as squamous cell carcinoma, moderately differentiated, with a maximum dimension of 6.0 cm. According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor more than 4 cm in greatest dimension in the oral cavity is classified as T3.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):** The report indicates metastasis in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes, with 6 out of 46 lymph nodes involved. The largest involved lymph node measures 3.5 cm, and there is extensive extracapsular extension. This corresponds to N2b, which is defined as metastasis in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes, none more than 6 cm in greatest dimension.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** The report states pMX, meaning distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Based on the TNM classification:
- T3 (tumor > 4 cm)
- N2b (multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes involved)
- M0 (no distant metastasis assessed, but typically assumed absent unless specified)

According to the AJCC staging system for oral cavity cancers:
- T3 N2b M0 corresponds to Stage IVa.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IV""}"
31,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following relevant information for staging:

1. **Tumor Size and Invasion**: The primary tumor is 1.9 cm in greatest dimension, which corresponds to T1 (tumor â‰¤ 2 cm in greatest dimension).

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: There is metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in one of twenty-seven lymph nodes, which corresponds to N1 (metastasis in a single ipsilateral lymph node, 3 cm or less in greatest dimension).

3. **Distant Metastasis**: The report does not provide information on distant metastasis (pMX), but for staging purposes, we assume M0 (no distant metastasis) unless otherwise specified.

Based on the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for oral cavity cancers, the combination of T1, N1, and M0 corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
32,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to consider the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and presence of metastasis.

1. **Tumor Size and Invasion**: The report indicates an invasive squamous carcinoma with a size of 2.8 cm in the largest dimension and a depth of invasion of 1.3 cm. According to AJCC staging for oral cavity cancers, a tumor size of 2-4 cm without extrapolating into adjacent structures is typically classified as T2.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The pathology report states that multiple lymph nodes were examined (levels I-IV), and all were negative for tumor involvement (0/53 lymph nodes). This indicates N0, meaning no regional lymph node metastasis.

3. **Distant Metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so we assume M0.

Based on the TNM classification:
- T2 (tumor size 2-4 cm)
- N0 (no regional lymph node involvement)
- M0 (no distant metastasis)

The combination of T2, N0, M0 corresponds to Stage II according to the AJCC staging system for oral cavity cancers.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
33,"## Answer
The pathology report provides detailed information about the tumor and lymph node involvement, which are critical for determining the AJCC stage of cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (pT):** The tumor is described as being 2.7 x 2.6 x 0.7 cm in size, which places it in the pT2 category (Tumor more than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension).

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN):** The report indicates metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in 2 of 18 level II lymph nodes, with no metastasis in level III and IV lymph nodes. This corresponds to pN2b (Metastasis in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes, none more than 6 cm in greatest dimension).

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM):** The report does not provide information on distant metastasis (pMX), meaning it cannot be assessed.

Based on the AJCC staging system for oropharyngeal cancer:
- **Stage I:** pT1, pN0, pM0
- **Stage II:** pT2, pN0, pM0
- **Stage III:** pT3 or pN1, pM0
- **Stage IV:** pT4 or pN2/pN3 or pM1

Given the tumor is pT2 and the lymph node involvement is pN2b, the cancer is classified as Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IV""}"

The pathology report describes a squamous carcinoma of the floor of the mouth and anterior arch of the mandible. Key details from the report include:

1. **Tumor Size**: The tumor measures 2.6 x 2.2 x 2.1 cm.
2. **Invasion**: The carcinoma is invading the mandible and infiltrating skeletal muscle, with perineural involvement.
3. **Margins**: Initially, the tumor extends to the right lingual surgical resection margin, but after further examination (new right lingual margin), the resection margins are free of tumor.
4. **Differentiation**: The carcinoma is moderately differentiated.

According to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for oral cavity cancers, the staging is based on the size of the tumor (T), involvement of lymph nodes (N), and presence of metastasis (M). 

- **T1**: Tumor â‰¤ 2 cm.
- **T2**: Tumor > 2 cm but â‰¤ 4 cm.
- **T3**: Tumor > 4 cm or extension to lingual surface of epiglottis.
- **T4a**: Moderately advanced local disease (e.g., invasion into adjacent structures such as the mandible, maxilla, or skin).
- **T4b**: Very advanced local disease (e.g., invasion into masticator space, pterygoid plates, or skull base, or encases internal carotid artery).

Given the tumor size (2.6 cm), it falls under T2. However, the invasion into the mandible and skeletal muscle suggests a more advanced local disease, potentially T4a. The report does not mention lymph node involvement (N) or distant metastasis (M), which are crucial for determining the overall stage.

- **Stage I**: T1, N0, M0
- **Stage II**: T2, N0, M0
- **Stage III**: T3, N0, M0 or T1-T3, N1, M0
- **Stage IV**: T4a or T4b, any N, M0 or any T, N2 or N3, M0 or any T, any N, M1

Considering the tumor's invasion into the mandible, it is likely classified as T4a. Without information on"

The pathology report provides the following key information for staging the cancer according to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) guidelines:

1. **Primary Tumor (T) Stage**: The report indicates a pathologic stage of pT4a. According to AJCC, T4a indicates a tumor that invades through the thyroid cartilage and/or invades tissues beyond the larynx (e.g., trachea, soft tissues of the neck including deep/extrinsic muscle of the tongue, strap muscles, thyroid, or esophagus).

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N) Stage**: The report indicates a pathologic stage of pN2a. N2a indicates metastasis in a single ipsilateral lymph node, 3 cm or less in greatest dimension.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M) Stage**: The report indicates pMX, meaning distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Based on the AJCC staging system for laryngeal cancer:
- Stage IV is divided into IVA, IVB, and IVC. 
- Stage IVA includes T4a, N0 or N1, M0, or T1-T4a, N2, M0.
- Stage IVB includes any T, N3, M0 or T4b, any N, M0.
- Stage IVC includes any T, any N, M1.

Given the information:
- The tumor is T4a.
- There is N2a lymph node involvement.
- M stage is MX (not assessed, but typically considered M0 unless proven otherwise).

Therefore, the combination of T4a, N2a, and MX (considered M0 for staging purposes) corresponds to Stage IVA.

Therefore, the answer is -

36,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging:

1. **Primary Tumor (T):** The tumor is 3.5 cm in greatest dimension and invades the underlying skeletal muscle with very focal invasion of minor salivary gland tissue. There is no gross bony invasion. According to the AJCC 6th edition, a tumor greater than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension is classified as T2.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):** Metastatic carcinoma is found in 1 out of 26 lymph nodes, specifically 1 out of 11 level II lymph nodes. There is no evidence of extracapsular soft tissue extension. This corresponds to N1, which indicates metastasis in a single ipsilateral lymph node, 3 cm or less in greatest dimension.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** The report states pMx, indicating that distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Based on the information provided:
- The tumor size and local invasion classify it as T2.
- The involvement of one lymph node classifies it as N1.
- Distant metastasis is not assessed (Mx).

According to the AJCC 6th edition staging system:
- T2 N1 Mx corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
37,"## Answer
The pathology report indicates the presence of invasive, moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with focal perineural invasion. The primary tumor is located in the tongue and pharynx, with all margins free of tumor, suggesting complete resection of the primary site. However, the report also notes metastatic squamous cell carcinoma present in 1 of 2 lymph nodes, indicating regional lymph node involvement. Additionally, there is metastatic carcinoma in the soft tissue, although the soft tissue margins are free of tumor. 

According to the AJCC staging system for head and neck cancers, the presence of regional lymph node metastasis typically indicates at least Stage III disease. The involvement of lymph nodes and the presence of metastatic carcinoma in soft tissue suggest a more advanced stage. 

Stage IV is characterized by extensive local invasion, involvement of multiple lymph nodes, or distant metastasis. Given the presence of metastatic carcinoma in the lymph nodes and soft tissue, this aligns with Stage IV criteria.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IV""}"
38,"## Answer
The pathology report provides detailed information about the tumor and lymph node involvement, which are critical for determining the AJCC stage of cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (pT):** The tumor is described as being located in the right hypopharynx with involvement of the right piriform sinus and right vocal cord. The tumor measures 4.7 x 3.7 x 2.6 cm. According to the AJCC staging criteria provided, a pT3 classification is given for a tumor that measures more than 4 cm in greatest dimension or with fixation of the hemilarynx or extension to the esophagus. The tumor in this case measures more than 4 cm, thus it is classified as pT3.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN):** The report indicates that there is metastatic squamous cell carcinoma involving three out of twenty-nine lymph nodes on the right side (3/29), with the largest positive lymph node measuring 3.3 cm. The classification pN2b is given for metastasis in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes, none more than 6 cm in greatest dimension. This matches the description in the report, as there are multiple positive lymph nodes on the ipsilateral side, none exceeding 6 cm.

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM):** The report does not mention any distant metastasis, so we assume pM0 (no distant metastasis).

Based on the TNM classification:
- **T3**: Tumor measures more than 4 cm.
- **N2b**: Metastasis in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes, none more than 6 cm.
- **M0**: No distant metastasis.

According to the AJCC staging system, a combination of T3, N2b, and M0 corresponds to Stage IVa for hypopharyngeal cancer.

Therefore, the answer is -

39,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging the cancer according to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) guidelines:

1. **Primary Tumor (pT):** The report states ""pT4a"". According to AJCC, T4a indicates a tumor that invades through cortical bone, into deep (extrinsic) muscle of tongue, maxillary sinus, or skin of face.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN):** The report states ""pNO"", which means no regional lymph node metastasis is present. A total of 44 lymph nodes were examined, and none were involved.

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM):** The report states ""pMX"", which means distant metastasis cannot be assessed. However, typically, if there is no evidence of distant metastasis, it is considered M0.

Based on the AJCC staging system for oral cavity cancers:

- **Stage I:** T1, N0, M0
- **Stage II:** T2, N0, M0
- **Stage III:** T3, N0, M0 or T1-T3, N1, M0
- **Stage IV:** T4a or T4b, any N, M0 or any T, N2 or N3, M0 or any T, any N, M1

Given the information:
- The tumor is classified as T4a.
- There is no lymph node involvement (N0).
- Distant metastasis is not assessed (MX), but typically considered M0 if not specified otherwise.

The presence of a T4a tumor with N0 and presumed M0 classifies the cancer as Stage IV according to the AJCC guidelines.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IV""}"
40,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to consider the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and any distant metastasis.

1. **Tumor Size**: The tumor is described as being up to 5 cm in size. According to AJCC staging for oral cavity cancers, a tumor greater than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm is typically classified as T2. However, since this tumor is 5 cm, it would be classified as T3.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report mentions that there are six lymph nodes with normal morphological structure, indicating no lymph node involvement. This suggests N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis).

3. **Distant Metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so we assume M0 (no distant metastasis).

Based on these factors:
- T3 (tumor > 4 cm)
- N0 (no lymph node involvement)
- M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC staging system for oral cavity cancers, a T3, N0, M0 classification corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
41,"## Answer
The pathology report indicates the presence of poorly differentiated squamous carcinoma in multiple locations, including the mandible, upper lip, and floor of the mouth. The report mentions invasive squamous carcinoma with perineural invasion and questionable lymphatics, which suggests potential spread beyond the primary site. However, the margins of resection are free of carcinoma, indicating that the tumor has not spread to the edges of the resected tissue. The presence of perineural invasion and the mention of questionable lymphatics suggest a more advanced stage, potentially involving regional spread. 

According to the AJCC staging system for oral cavity cancers, Stage I and II are typically confined to the primary site without regional lymph node involvement or distant metastasis. Stage III often involves larger tumors or regional lymph node involvement. Stage IV indicates further spread, either to distant sites or extensive regional involvement.

Given the presence of perineural invasion and the complexity of the case with multiple sites involved, it is likely that the cancer is at least Stage III. However, without explicit mention of distant metastasis or extensive regional lymph node involvement, Stage IV might not be applicable.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
42,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information:

1. **Tumor Characteristics**: The tumor is a moderately-differentiated invasive squamous cell carcinoma located on the right tongue and mouth floor. It measures 5.0 cm in greatest dimension and invades the deep tongue muscles but does not invade the mandible. All surgical margins are negative, with the closest margin being 0.6 cm.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: A total of 16 lymph nodes were examined (13 from right neck levels 2 and 3, 2 from right neck level 1B, and 1 prehyoid lymph node), and all were negative for malignancy (0/16).

3. **AJCC Staging Information**: The report explicitly states the findings correspond with AJCC pathologic Stage IVA (pT4a, pN0).

Based on the AJCC staging system for oral cavity cancers:
- **T4a** indicates a tumor that invades through cortical bone, into deep/extrinsic muscle of tongue, maxillary sinus, or skin of face.
- **N0** indicates no regional lymph node metastasis.

The report confirms the tumor is classified as T4a due to its invasion into deep tongue muscles, and N0 due to the absence of lymph node metastasis. The combination of T4a and N0, according to AJCC guidelines, corresponds to Stage IVA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IV""}"

The pathology report indicates the presence of invasive squamous carcinoma in the left partial glossectomy specimen. The tumor is moderately differentiated, with a size of 3.4 cm in the largest dimension and a depth of invasion of 1.4 cm. There is perineural invasion present, but no vascular invasion. Importantly, all lymph nodes from the neck dissection (levels I-IV) are negative for tumor involvement (0/43 lymph nodes). The mucosal and deep margins are negative for invasive carcinoma, although there is severe dysplasia at the posterolateral margin.

According to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for oral cavity cancers, the primary tumor (T) is classified based on size and extent of invasion. A tumor greater than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension is classified as T2. The absence of regional lymph node metastasis (N0) and distant metastasis (M0) are also noted.

- T2: Tumor more than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension.
- N0: No regional lymph node metastasis.
- M0: No distant metastasis.

Based on these criteria, the cancer is classified as Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is -

The pathology report provides detailed information about the patient's cancer diagnosis. The key findings are:

1. **Lymph Nodes**: All lymph nodes examined (total of 36) are negative for malignancy, indicating no regional lymph node metastasis (N0).

2. **Primary Tumor**: The primary tumor is an invasive squamous cell carcinoma, moderately differentiated, measuring 3.0 cm in greatest dimension. It involves the bilateral inferior epiglottis and extends through the epiglottis into the pre-epiglottic space. The thyroid cartilage is not present, which suggests that the tumor has not invaded the thyroid cartilage.

3. **AJCC Staging**: The report explicitly states that the cancer corresponds to AJCC stage III (pT3, N0, MX). The T3 classification is due to the tumor size and its extension into the pre-epiglottic space.

4. **Metastasis**: The MX designation indicates that distant metastasis cannot be assessed, but the absence of lymph node involvement (N0) supports the stage III classification.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the explicit mention in the report, the cancer is classified as Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is -
