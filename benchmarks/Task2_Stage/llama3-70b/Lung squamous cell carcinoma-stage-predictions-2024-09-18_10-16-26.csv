Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor (pT) is classified as pT3, which means the tumor is larger than 5 cm or has invaded the mediastinum or involves the visceral pleura.
2. The regional lymph nodes (pN) are classified as pN1, which means there is metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes.
3. The metastasis (pM) is classified as pMX, which means distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Based on the pT3 and pN1 classifications, the AJCC stage is Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
1,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions a 1.1 cm moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in the lung, which is T1a according to the AJCC 8th edition staging system (tumor size ≤ 1 cm).
2. The tumor invades the overlying pleura, which is classified as PL1 (invasion of visceral pleura). This does not affect the T stage.
3. There is no lymphovascular invasion mentioned in the report.
4. The report states that the benign intrapulmonary lymph node is negative for carcinoma, indicating that there is no nodal involvement (N0).
5. The margin of resection is negative for carcinoma, which means that the tumor has been completely resected.
6. The report also mentions a segment of the 6th rib resection, which is negative for carcinoma. This suggests that there is no distant metastasis (M0).

Based on the above information, the TNM staging is T1a, N0, M0.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T1a, N0, M0 tumor corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
2,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor (T) is described as a 27 mm poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma in the right upper lobe, with focal blood vessel and perineural invasion, but no lymphatic permeation. This corresponds to a T1 tumor, as it is ≤ 3 cm in size.

2. The lymph nodes (N) are involved, with a deposit of poorly differentiated carcinoma present within the hilar lymph node cortex. This indicates N1 disease, as the tumor has metastasized to the hilar lymph nodes.

3. There is no mention of distant metastases (M) in the report, so we can assume M0.

Based on the TNM classification, the patient has a T1N1M0 tumor.

According to the AJCC staging system, a T1N1M0 tumor corresponds to Stage IIA.

However, the options provided do not include Stage IIA. The closest match is Stage II, which is a reasonable approximation given the T1N1M0 classification.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
3,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the left lung, and it is a Grade II-III squamous carcinoma that involves the pleura and focally extends to the inked pleural margin.

2. The vascular and bronchial margins of resection are negative, indicating that the tumor has not invaded these areas.

3. There are six lymph nodes in the left lung, and all of them are negative for tumor (0/6).

4. The report also mentions lymph nodes from other levels (Level 9, Level 10, Level 5, and Level 7), but all of them are negative for tumor.

Based on the above information, we can determine the T, N, and M stages as follows:

* T stage: The tumor is T2, as it is larger than 3 cm but has not invaded the mediastinum or other organs.
* N stage: The N stage is N0, as all the lymph nodes examined are negative for tumor.
* M stage: There is no evidence of distant metastasis, so the M stage is M0.

According to the AJCC staging system, a T2N0M0 tumor corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
4,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (T)**: The tumor is described as an exophytic invasive moderately to poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, measuring 3.7 x 2.8 x 2.8 cm. According to the AJCC 8th edition, this corresponds to a T2 tumor, as it is larger than 3 cm but not larger than 5 cm.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N)**: The report indicates that one out of ten peribronchial lymph nodes is positive for metastasis (N1). This suggests that the tumor has spread to the ipsilateral hilar and/or peribronchial lymph nodes.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: There is no evidence of distant metastasis (M0).

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* T2 (primary tumor size)
* N1 (lymph node involvement)
* M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, this corresponds to **Stage IIA**.

However, since the options provided do not include Stage IIA, we need to consider the closest match. Stage II is not a perfect match, as it would require N0 (no lymph node involvement) or N1 (ipsilateral hilar and/or peribronchial lymph nodes), but not both. Stage III is also not a perfect match, as it would require N2 (ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes) or N3 (contralateral mediastinal/hilar, scalene, or supraclavicular lymph nodes), which is not the case here.

Given the options provided, the closest match would be **(B) Stage II**, as it is the most similar to the actual stage (Stage IIA).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage II}"
5,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor type is squamous cell carcinoma, and the histologic grade is moderately differentiated.
2. The tumor size is 2.4 cm, which corresponds to T1b (tumor size > 2 cm but ≤ 3 cm).
3. The surgical margins are free of tumor, and there is no direct extension of the tumor.
4. Lymphatic and venous invasions are absent.
5. A total of 7 lymph nodes were examined, and none of them were involved with cancer (pNO).
6. The tumor approaches but does not involve the visceral pleura.

Based on these findings, the TNM staging is pT1b, pNO, and pMX (metastasis cannot be assessed).

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a tumor with T1b and N0 staging corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
6,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor (pT) is classified as pT2a, which means the tumor is > 3 cm and < 5 cm in greatest dimension, surrounded by lung or visceral pleura, without bronchoscopic evidence of invasion in the main bronchus.

2. The regional lymph nodes (pN) are classified as pNO, which means there is no regional lymph node metastasis.

3. There is no mention of distant metastasis (pM) in the report.

Based on the TNM classification, the patient has a pT2a primary tumor and pNO regional lymph nodes, which corresponds to Stage II cancer according to the AJCC staging system.

Therefore, the answer is -

{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
8,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions a primary tumor in the right lower lobe of the lung, measuring 5 x 4.5 x 2.6 cm, which is a significant size. However, it does not extend through the pleura, which suggests that the tumor is still localized within the lung.

2. The bronchial margin is negative for tumor, indicating that the tumor has not invaded the bronchus.

3. Multiple intrapulmonary peribronchial lymph nodes are negative for tumor, which suggests that the tumor has not spread to the regional lymph nodes within the lung.

4. The report also mentions that multiple superior and inferior mediastinal lymph nodes, as well as N1 lymph nodes, are negative for tumor. This indicates that the tumor has not spread to the mediastinal lymph nodes or the N1 lymph nodes.

Based on these findings, we can conclude that the tumor is localized within the lung, has not invaded the bronchus, and has not spread to the regional lymph nodes. This corresponds to the T2 category (tumor > 4 cm in greatest dimension) and N0 category (no regional lymph node metastasis).

According to the AJCC staging system, a T2N0 tumor corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
9,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the left upper lobe of the lung, and its greatest diameter is 3.2 cm, which corresponds to a T2 tumor (T1: ≤ 3 cm, T2: > 3 cm but ≤ 5 cm, T3: > 5 cm but ≤ 7 cm, T4: > 7 cm).
2. The tumor involves the visceral pleura, but there is no vascular invasion, perineural invasion, or bronchial margin involvement.
3. The lymph node status is as follows: peribronchial lymph nodes are 0/8, indicating no metastasis to these nodes.
4. Multiple mediastinal lymph nodes were examined (Levels 5, 6, 7, and 11), and all were benign, with no evidence of metastasis.

Based on the above information, we can determine the N stage as N0, since there is no metastasis to any of the examined lymph nodes.

Combining the T and N stages, we get a stage of T2N0. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2N0 tumor corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage II}"
10,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Primary tumor (pT): The report states that the primary tumor is pT1b, which means the tumor is 2 cm or less in size and has not invaded the visceral pleura.

2. Regional lymph nodes (pN): The report states that the regional lymph nodes are pNO, which means there is no evidence of tumor in the lymph nodes.

3. Distant metastasis (pM): The report states that distant metastasis is not applicable, which means there is no evidence of distant metastasis.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

Since the primary tumor is pT1b and there is no evidence of regional lymph node involvement (pNO) or distant metastasis, the AJCC stage of the cancer is Stage I.

11,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary tumor (T stage)**: The report states that the tumor is an invasive squamous cell carcinoma, 4.5 cm in diameter, with visceral pleural and angiolymphatic invasion. This corresponds to a T4 stage, as the tumor has invaded the visceral pleura.

2. **Lymph node involvement (N stage)**: The report mentions that one out of 12 N1 lymph nodes is positive for metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. This corresponds to an N1 stage, as there is involvement of ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes.

3. **Distant metastasis (M stage)**: The report does not mention any distant metastases, so the M stage is MX (cannot be assessed).

Based on the T4N1MX staging, the AJCC stage of the cancer is **Stage III**.

Therefore, the answer is -

12,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions a 2.3 x 2 x 1.8 cm mass in the left upper lobe of the lung, which is a primary tumor (T). Since it abuts but does not directly invade the pleura, we can classify it as T2a (tumor 2-3 cm in greatest dimension).

2. The report does not mention any distant metastases (M), so we can assume M0 (no distant metastases).

3. The report mentions that multiple lymph nodes were excised, including inferior mediastinal, aortic, and N1 lymph nodes. However, all of these lymph nodes were negative for tumor, indicating that there is no nodal involvement (N0).

4. Based on the TNM classification, a T2a primary tumor with N0 nodal involvement and M0 distant metastases corresponds to Stage I.

13,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the left lung, and it measures 2.5 cm in greatest dimension, which corresponds to a T2 tumor (PT2).
2. The pleura, bronchial, and vascular margins are negative for tumor, indicating that the tumor has not invaded these structures.
3. The peribronchial lymph nodes are negative for tumor (0/9), indicating that there is no nodal involvement in the lung (N0).
4. The tumor has involved the left main bronchus, but there is no evidence of distant metastases.
5. The lymph nodes in the inferior pulmonary vein, level 5, level 7, and level 9 are all negative for tumor, indicating that there is no nodal involvement in these stations.

Based on the above findings, the tumor can be staged as follows:

* T2 (primary tumor size 2.5 cm)
* N0 (no nodal involvement)
* M0 (no distant metastases)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2N0M0 tumor corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
14,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to analyze the pathology report and identify the key components that contribute to the staging.

First, we look at the Pathological T (pT) stage, which is T2a. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual, a T2a tumor is defined as a tumor that is >2 cm but ≤4 cm in greatest dimension. This is consistent with the reported tumor size of 4.2999999999999998 cm.

Next, we examine the Pathological N (pN) stage, which is N1. This indicates that there is metastasis to 1-3 lymph nodes.

The Clinical M (cM) stage is reported as M0, indicating no distant metastasis.

Using the AJCC 8th edition staging manual, we can combine the pT and pN stages to determine the overall stage. For a T2a tumor with N1 lymph node involvement, the corresponding stage is Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
15,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The specimen type is a lobectomy, which means the entire lung lobe was removed, suggesting that the tumor is localized to the lung.

2. The tumor size is 3 X 3 X 3.5 cm, which is a significant size but does not provide direct information about the stage.

3. The histologic type is squamous cell carcinoma, which is a type of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The histologic grade is moderately differentiated, which does not affect the staging.

4. The tumor extent is not specified, which means we cannot determine if the tumor has invaded nearby structures or not.

5. There is no information about lymph nodes, lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, or margins, which are important factors in determining the stage.

Given the limited information, we can only conclude that the tumor is localized to the lung (T1-2) and there is no evidence of distant metastases (M0). However, we cannot determine the N stage (lymph node involvement) or the presence of invasion into nearby structures.

Based on the available information, the most likely stage is Stage I, as the tumor is localized to the lung and there is no evidence of lymph node involvement or distant metastases.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
16,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (T)**: The tumor size is 4.2 x 4.0 x 2.3 cm, which corresponds to T2a (tumor > 3 cm but ≤ 5 cm in greatest dimension).
2. **Visceral Pleural Invasion (VPI)**: The report mentions ""Tumor invades the pleura"" under Surgical Margin Status, which indicates VPI is present.
3. **Lymph Node Status (N)**: Only 1 peribronchial node was received, and it did not contain metastatic carcinoma, so N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis).
4. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so M0 (no distant metastasis).

Based on the above information, the pTNM stage is pT2a N0 M0, which corresponds to **Stage II** according to the AJCC 8th edition staging system.

1. The report mentions ""Squamous cell carcinoma"" as the histological description, which indicates the type of cancer.

2. The TNM Stage is mentioned as T2, N2, M0.

3. According to the AJCC staging system, the T stage represents the primary tumor, N stage represents the regional lymph nodes, and M stage represents distant metastasis.

4. A T2 stage indicates that the primary tumor is larger than 3 cm but not more than 5 cm in greatest dimension, or it has grown into the bronchus and is 2 cm or more distal to the carina, but not involving the visceral pleura.

5. An N2 stage indicates that there is metastasis to ipsilateral mediastinal or subcarinal lymph nodes.

6. An M0 stage indicates that there is no distant metastasis.

7. Based on the TNM stages, the overall stage can be determined. According to the AJCC staging system, a T2, N2, M0 corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
19,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

First, we need to identify the T, N, and M stages from the report.

* T stage: The tumour is 57 mm in greatest dimension and invades the pericardium, but does not extend through to the inner mesothelial-lined surface. This corresponds to a T3 stage (tumour > 5 cm or invades the pericardium).
* N stage: There is no evidence of lymph node metastases, so the N stage is NO.
* M stage: There is no mention of distant metastases, so the M stage is M0.

Now, we can determine the overall stage based on the T, N, and M stages. According to the AJCC staging system, a T3N0M0 corresponds to Stage II.

2. The tumor has extensive vascular invasion and focal perineural invasion, but no lymphatic invasion.
3. The soft tissue resection margin is clear of malignancy, and the upper lobe resection margin is also clear of malignancy.
4. The lymph node sampling reveals metastatic carcinoma in one of the lymph nodes (No. 11 lymph node), which corresponds to N1.

Based on the TNM classification, the patient has a T3 primary tumor, N1 lymph node involvement, and no distant metastases (M0). According to the AJCC staging system, this corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
21,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the primary tumor (T), lymph nodes (N), and distant metastasis (M).

From the pathology report, we can gather the following information:

* Primary tumor (T): The tumor is 6.4 cm in size, and it invades the adjacent structure, which is the chest wall and rib (T3).
* Lymph nodes (N): All sampled lymph nodes (8) are benign, which means there is no lymph node involvement (N0).
* Distant metastasis (M): There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so we can assume M0.

Based on the TNM classification, the patient has a pT3N0M0 tumor.

According to the AJCC staging system, a pT3N0M0 tumor corresponds to Stage IIB.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IIB}"
22,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to analyze the pathology report and identify the key features that determine the stage.

From the report, we can see that the tumor is a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with a diameter of 5.0 cm, which corresponds to a T2 tumor size (T2: tumor > 3 cm but ≤ 5 cm).

The report also mentions that there is no evidence of visceral pleural or angiolymphatic invasion, which suggests that the tumor has not invaded the visceral pleura or lymphatic vessels.

Regarding lymph node involvement, the report states that one of fifteen N1 lymph nodes is positive for metastases, which indicates that the tumor has spread to the regional lymph nodes (N1). However, there is no evidence of metastases in the N2 lymph nodes.

There is no mention of distant metastases (M) in the report, which suggests that the tumor has not spread to distant organs or tissues.

Based on these findings, the pathologic stage is T2N1MX.

According to the AJCC staging system, a T2N1MX tumor corresponds to Stage IIA.

Therefore, the answer is -

24,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Tumor size**: The tumor size is 3 x 2 x 2 cm, which is a relatively small size. This suggests that the primary tumor (T) is likely to be T1 or T2, as T3 tumors are typically larger than 5 cm.

2. **Lymph nodes**: The report states that 3 out of 6 lymph nodes are positive for metastasis, which indicates that the cancer has spread to the regional lymph nodes. This corresponds to N2, as N2 is defined as metastasis to ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes.

3. **Distant metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, which suggests that M0 (no distant metastasis) is likely.

4. **Combining T, N, and M**: Based on the above analysis, we have T1 or T2, N2, and M0. According to the AJCC staging system, this corresponds to Stage IIIA.

Therefore, the answer is -

25,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the cancer:

1. **Tumor size**: The tumor size is 8x8x8cm, which is a significant size, but it doesn't directly determine the stage.

2. **Tumor extent**: The tumor has invaded the visceral pleura, which indicates a T2 or higher classification (T2: tumor invades visceral pleura).

3. **Lymph nodes**: 8 out of 10 lymph nodes are positive for metastasis, which is a significant number. This indicates an N2 classification (N2: metastasis to ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes).

4. **Distant metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report.

Considering the above factors, we can determine the TNM classification as follows:

* T: T2 (tumor invades visceral pleura)
* N: N2 (metastasis to ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes)
* M: M0 (no distant metastasis)

2. The report does mention the ICD-0-3 Histology Code and ICD-0-3 Site Code, but these codes do not directly provide information about the stage of the cancer.

3. Without explicit information about the T, N, and M components, it is challenging to determine the AJCC stage accurately.

4. Given the lack of information, it is not possible to confidently assign a specific stage (I, II, III, or IV) to the cancer.

27,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor is a squamous cell carcinoma, moderately differentiated, with a maximal tumor size of 7.7 cm. This corresponds to a T2 tumor, as it is greater than 3 cm in greatest dimension.
2. The tumor invades the visceral pleura, which is also a feature of a T2 tumor.
3. There is no regional lymph node metastasis (pNO), which means the N stage is N0.
4. The surgical resection margins are negative for malignancy, and the distance of invasive carcinoma from the closest margin is 3.5 cm.

Based on the TNM staging system, the patient has a T2N0M0 tumor. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2N0M0 tumor corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
28,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the left upper lobe of the lung, measuring 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm, and is 1.8 cm away from the bronchial margin, which is negative for tumor. This suggests that the tumor is confined to the lung and has not invaded the bronchial margin.

2. The report mentions that multiple (10) intrapulmonary peribronchial lymph nodes are positive for tumor, which indicates lymph node involvement.

3. The visceral pleura is also involved, which suggests that the tumor has invaded the pleura.

4. The report also mentions that multiple lymph nodes in the superior mediastinal, aortic, inferior mediastinal, and left lower lobe bronchus regions are negative for tumor.

Considering the above points, we can determine the T, N, and M stages as follows:

* T stage: The tumor is 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm in size and has invaded the visceral pleura, which corresponds to a T2b stage (tumor > 2 cm in greatest dimension and invades the visceral pleura).
* N stage: The presence of tumor in multiple intrapulmonary peribronchial lymph nodes corresponds to an N1 stage (metastasis to intrapulmonary nodes).
* M stage: There is no evidence of distant metastasis, so the M stage is M0.

Based on the T, N, and M stages, we can determine the overall AJCC stage. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2bN1M0 stage corresponds to Stage IIA.

However, since the options provided do not include Stage IIA, we need to consider the closest match. Given that the tumor has invaded the visceral pleura and has lymph node involvement, the closest match would be Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
29,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (T)**: The tumor size is 4.5 cm, and it invades the visceral pleura but not the pericardium. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, this corresponds to a T2 tumor.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N)**: The pathology report states that 7 lymph nodes were examined, and none of them were involved by the tumor (pNO). This indicates that the regional lymph nodes are not affected by the cancer.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the pathology report, so we can assume that the cancer has not spread to other parts of the body (pMX).

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage of the cancer. Since the tumor is T2, N0, and MX, it corresponds to **Stage II** according to the AJCC 8th edition staging system.

* pT3 (primary tumor with visceral pleural invasion and peripheral extension)
* pN1 (regional lymph node metastasis)
* pMX (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC staging system, a pT3 primary tumor with pN1 regional lymph node metastasis corresponds to **Stage III**.

Therefore, the answer is -

31,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions the tumor size as 3 X 2.5 X 2 cm, which is a key factor in determining the T stage (primary tumor size).
2. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a tumor size of 3 cm or less corresponds to a T1 stage.
3. There is no mention of lymph node involvement or distant metastases in the report, which suggests that the N stage (lymph node involvement) and M stage (distant metastases) are likely N0 and M0, respectively.
4. Since the report does not provide information on lymph node involvement or distant metastases, we cannot rule out the possibility of N1, N2, or M1 stages. However, based on the available information, it is reasonable to assume that the N and M stages are likely to be N0 and M0, respectively.
5. Combining the T1 stage with the assumed N0 and M0 stages, we can determine the overall stage of the cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
32,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (T)**: The tumor size is 4.0 cm, which corresponds to pT2 (tumor with any of the following features of size or extent: greater than 3 cm in greatest dimension).
2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N)**: One lobar lymph node out of nine lymph nodes is positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma, which corresponds to pN1 (metastasis in ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes, including intrapulmonary nodes involved by direct extension of the primary tumor).
3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so pMX (cannot be assessed) is assigned.

Based on the pTNM classification, the patient has a pT2N1 tumor. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a pT2N1 tumor corresponds to **Stage IIb**.

However, since the options provided do not include Stage IIb, we need to consider the closest match. Stage II and Stage III are the closest options. Since the patient has a pT2N1 tumor, which is more advanced than a Stage II tumor (typically pT1-2N0), but less advanced than a Stage III tumor (typically pT3-4N1-2), we can conclude that the patient's tumor is more likely to be classified as **Stage III**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
33,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (pT)**: The report states that the tumor measures 4.9 cm in maximum dimension, which corresponds to pT2a (Tumor > 3 cm, and < 5 cm in greatest dimension surrounded by lung or visceral pleura, without bronchoscopic evidence of invasion in the main bronchus).

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN)**: The report indicates that multiple lymph nodes were excised and examined, but none of them showed malignancy (0/6). This corresponds to pN0 (No regional lymph node metastasis).

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM)**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so pM is not applicable.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

**AJCC Stage**: The combination of pT2a and pN0 corresponds to Stage II (T2a, N0, M0).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
34,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary tumor (pT)**: The tumor measures 5.5 cm in dimension and extends through the pleura but is not identified at the outer surface of the specimen. This corresponds to a T2b tumor (tumor > 5 cm in greatest dimension).
2. **Margins of resection**: The margins are negative for tumor.
3. **Direct extension of tumor**: The tumor extends into the pleura, which shows a desmoplastic response to tumor.
4. **Vessel invasion**: Not identified.
5. **Regional lymph nodes (pN)**: pNO, meaning no regional lymph node metastases are identified.
6. **Distant metastasis (pM)**: pMx, meaning distant metastases cannot be assessed.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* Tumor (T): T2b (tumor > 5 cm in greatest dimension)
* Node (N): N0 (no regional lymph node metastases)
* Metastasis (M): Mx (distant metastases cannot be assessed)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2b tumor with N0 nodes and Mx metastasis corresponds to **Stage II**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
35,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to analyze the pathology report and identify the key features that affect staging.

First, we look at the tumor size, which is 4.9 x 4.7 x 4.5 cm, making it a T3 tumor (tumor > 5 cm in greatest dimension).

Next, we examine the lymph node status. The report indicates that the lobar lymph nodes are negative for carcinoma, which means there is no lymph node involvement (N0).

Now, let's look at the pleural surface status. The report states that the carcinoma invades through the visceral and parietal pleura into the chest wall skeletal muscle and into the rib bone, which is classified as PL3 (pleural invasion).

Based on these findings, we can determine the pathologic stage (TNM classification) as pT3 pNO PL3.

According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a T3 classification, no lymph node involvement (N0), and pleural invasion (PL3) corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
36,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer:

1. The primary tumor (T) is described as a 4.5 x 4 x 3 cm intrabronchial and parenchymal hilar mass, which is a significant size. However, there is no mention of invasion into the pleura or chest wall, so it's likely a T2 or T3.

2. The report mentions that the tumor extends to within a few millimeters of the bronchial margin, which is involved by extensive in situ carcinoma. This suggests that the tumor has not invaded the bronchial margin, which is a key factor in determining the T stage.

3. The lymph node involvement is extensive, with metastases in multiple intrapulmonary peribronchial lymph nodes (6 of 14), aortopulmonary lymph nodes (2 of 2), and anterior mediastinal lymph nodes (1 of 2). This indicates a high degree of lymph node involvement, likely N3.

4. There is no mention of distant metastases in the report, which suggests that the M stage is M0.

Based on the above analysis, the TNM stages are likely T2 or T3, N3, and M0. According to the AJCC staging system, this corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the right lower lobe, and its size is 3.5 cm in greatest dimension (reported in section B of the pathology report).
2. The tumor is predominantly endobronchial but with pulmonary parenchymal invasion, and the closest inked pleural margin is negative for malignancy (reported in section B).
3. There is no lymphovascular invasion, and the bronchus and blood vessels at the surgical margin are negative for malignancy (reported in section B).
4. No hilar lymph nodes are identified with cancer (reported in section B).
5. Multiple lymph nodes from different locations (subcarinal, right hilum, right lower peritracheal area) are examined, and all are benign anthracotic lymph nodes (reported in sections C, D, and E).

Based on the above information, we can determine the T, N, and M stages as follows:

* T stage: T2 (tumor size is 3.5 cm, and there is pulmonary parenchymal invasion)
* N stage: N0 (no lymph nodes are involved with cancer)
* M stage: M0 (no distant metastases are reported)

38,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the right lower lobe lung, measuring 2.9 x 2.5 x 1.8 cm.
2. The tumor extends subpleurally but not to the pleural surface, which suggests a T2a tumor (since it's larger than 2 cm but not more than 3 cm in greatest dimension, and it doesn't invade the visceral pleura).
3. There is no vascular invasion or perineural invasion identified.
4. The bronchial margin is free of tumor.
5. The lymph node status is as follows: all lymph nodes examined (Level VII mediastinal, Level VII mediastinal #2, Right mediastinal lymph node level XI) are benign, with no metastatic nodes identified. This suggests an N0 lymph node status.
6. There is no evidence of distant metastasis (M0) in the report.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* Tumor (T): T2a (since the tumor is larger than 2 cm but not more than 3 cm in greatest dimension, and it doesn't invade the visceral pleura)
* Node (N): N0 (since all lymph nodes examined are benign with no metastatic nodes identified)
* Metastasis (M): M0 (since there is no evidence of distant metastasis)

Therefore, the AJCC stage is Stage I (T2a, N0, M0).

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary diagnosis is a large, intermediate to peripheral bronchopulmonary, histologically poorly differentiated, large-cell and polymorphocellular nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma of the right lower lobe of the lung.
2. The TNM classification is provided as pT2 pNO pMX R0, which indicates:
   - pT2: The primary tumor is larger than 3 cm but not more than 5 cm in greatest dimension, or the tumor is more than 5 cm in greatest dimension but does not invade the visceral pleura (in this case, the tumor is 8.5 cm in size, but it does not invade the visceral pleura).
   - pNO: No regional lymph node metastases are present.
   - pMX: The presence of distant metastases cannot be assessed.
   - R0: The surgical margins are tumor-free.
3. The report mentions that the resection margin of the bronchus and vessels and all lymph nodes identified and excised are tumor-free, which supports the pNO classification.
4. There is no evidence of distant metastases (pMX), and the report does not suggest any metastases to other organs or tissues.

Based on the TNM classification, the patient has a pT2 tumor with no regional lymph node metastases (pNO) and no distant metastases (pMX). According to the AJCC staging system, this corresponds to Stage IB.

{""stage"" : ""Stage IB""}"
40,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions that the tumor is staged as pT3 due to the presence of separate tumor nodules in the same lobe, away from the main central tumor.
2. The tumor size is reported as 5.5 cm x 4.0 cm x 3.5 cm, which is greater than 7 cm in greatest dimension, which would also qualify as pT3.
3. There is no evidence of tumor extension to the chest wall, diaphragm, phrenic nerve, mediastinal pleura, or parietal pericardium, which would have upgraded the tumor stage to pT4.
4. The bronchial and vascular margins of resection are negative for carcinoma, indicating that the tumor has not invaded these margins.
5. There is no evidence of lymphovascular invasion or extranodal extension.
6. The report mentions that 8 lymph nodes were examined, and none of them showed metastatic carcinoma, indicating pN0.
7. There is no mention of distant metastasis, so pM0.

Based on the above information, the TNM staging is pT3, pN0, and pM0.

According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor with pT3, pN0, and pM0 corresponds to Stage II.

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor size is 6.5 x 5.5 x 5.5 cm, which is a significant size, but it doesn't directly determine the stage.
2. The histologic type is squamous cell carcinoma, which is a type of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The histologic grade is poorly differentiated, which may affect the prognosis but not the stage.
3. The tumor extent is not specified, which means we can't determine if the tumor has invaded nearby structures or not.
4. The lymph nodes are 0/6 positive for metastasis, which means no lymph nodes are involved. This is a crucial factor in determining the stage.
5. There is no mention of distant metastases or other tumor nodules.

Based on the information provided, we can conclude that the tumor is relatively large (T2 or T3), but there is no lymph node involvement (N0) and no distant metastases (M0). According to the AJCC staging system, this corresponds to Stage II.

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The tumor size is 5.0 cm (T2).
* The tumor has invaded the mainstem bronchus and has perineural invasion.
* There is metastasis to regional lymph nodes, with 6/9 peribronchial lymph nodes and 1/1 parenchymal lymph nodes involved (N2).
* There is no distant metastasis (M0).

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a tumor with a size of 5.0 cm, invasion of the mainstem bronchus, and metastasis to regional lymph nodes (N2) corresponds to Stage IIIA.

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

The report indicates that the tumor is a large-cell and partly polymorphocellular squamous cell carcinoma located in the left upper lobe of the lung, with a size of 9 cm. The tumor extends to the pleura in the region of adhesion and to within 0.5 cm of the hilar resection surface.

The TNM classification is provided as pT2 pNO pMX V1 RX, which corresponds to:

* pT2: Tumor size > 3 cm but ≤ 5 cm (or > 5 cm with involvement of main bronchus, but not the carina)
* pNO: No regional lymph node metastasis
* pMX: Cannot be assessed for distant metastasis
* V1: Tumor invades visceral pleura
* RX: Resection margin is positive for tumor

Given the tumor size and extension to the pleura, the primary tumor (T) is classified as T2. The absence of regional lymph node metastasis (N0) and the presence of a positive resection margin (RX) are also important factors.

Considering the TNM classification and the pathology report, the AJCC stage of the cancer is Stage III.
