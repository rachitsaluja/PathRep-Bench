The pathology report provides detailed information about the lung cancer diagnosis. Let's break down the key elements relevant to staging:

1. **Primary Tumor (pT):** The report indicates a pT2a classification. This means the tumor is greater than 3 cm but 5 cm or less in greatest dimension, surrounded by lung or visceral pleura without bronchoscopic evidence of invasion more proximal than the lobar bronchus.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN):** The report states pN0, indicating no regional lymph node metastasis. All lymph nodes examined (levels 5, 7, and 9) were negative for carcinoma.

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM):** The report mentions ""Not applicable"" for distant metastasis, implying no evidence of distant spread.

4. **Multiple Primary Tumors:** The report notes ""m"" for multiple primary tumors, indicating synchronous carcinomas in the lingula and left lower lobe. However, these are considered separate primaries rather than metastatic spread.

Based on the AJCC staging system for lung cancer:
- A pT2a tumor with pN0 and no distant metastasis (pM0) typically corresponds to Stage IB.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
1,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging the lung cancer:

1. **Tumor Size and Characteristics**: The tumor is an adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated, located in the subpleural right lower lung lobe, with a size of 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.6 cm. It shows pleural invasion but no lymphovascular space invasion.

2. **Lymph Node Status**: All lymph nodes examined (R lymph node, L lymph node, Station 11, Station 12, and Station 7) are negative for neoplasm, indicating no regional lymph node involvement.

3. **Staging Information**: The report explicitly states the stage as T2N0. 

- **T2** indicates a tumor size greater than 3 cm but less than or equal to 5 cm, or a tumor that involves the main bronchus, invades visceral pleura, or is associated with atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis that extends to the hilar region but does not involve the entire lung.
- **N0** indicates no regional lymph node metastasis.

According to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for lung cancer, a T2N0 classification corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
2,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging:

1. **Primary Tumor (pT):** The tumor is classified as pT1b, which indicates a tumor size greater than 2 cm but 3 cm or less in greatest dimension.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN):** The report indicates pN1, meaning there is metastasis in ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes and intrapulmonary nodes, including involvement by direct extension.

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM):** The status is pMX, meaning distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

According to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for lung cancer:

- **Stage I** typically involves pT1 or pT2 with pN0 (no regional lymph node involvement).
- **Stage II** involves pT1 or pT2 with pN1 (regional lymph node involvement).
- **Stage III** involves pT1 or pT2 with pN2 or higher, or pT3 with any N.
- **Stage IV** involves any T, any N, and pM1 (distant metastasis present).

Given the information:
- The tumor is pT1b.
- There is regional lymph node involvement (pN1).
- Distant metastasis cannot be assessed (pMX).

This aligns with **Stage II** lung cancer, as it involves a tumor size within the T1b category and regional lymph node involvement (N1) without confirmed distant metastasis.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
3,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging the cancer according to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) criteria:

1. **Tumor Size and Extent (T):** The tumor is described as a moderately-poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with a maximum size of 2.5 x 2.0 cm. The extent of invasion is noted as pT1, indicating a small tumor size with limited local invasion.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):** The report indicates pN2, meaning there is involvement of ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes. Specifically, ten out of twelve lymph nodes are involved by metastatic carcinoma, including the subcarinal lymph node.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** The report states pMX, which means distant metastasis cannot be assessed. However, there is no indication of distant metastasis being present.

Based on the AJCC staging system for lung cancer:
- **Stage I** typically involves a small tumor (T1) with no lymph node involvement (N0) and no distant metastasis (M0).
- **Stage II** involves a larger tumor or local invasion (T2 or T3) with limited lymph node involvement (N1) and no distant metastasis (M0).
- **Stage III** involves any tumor size with significant lymph node involvement (N2 or N3) and no distant metastasis (M0).
- **Stage IV** involves any tumor size with any lymph node involvement and distant metastasis (M1).

Given the information:
- The tumor is classified as pT1.
- There is significant lymph node involvement (pN2).
- There is no confirmed distant metastasis (pMX).

The presence of pN2 lymph node involvement without confirmed distant metastasis aligns with **Stage III** lung cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
4,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging the cancer:

1. **Primary Tumor (T):** The tumor is described as an invasive poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma measuring 2.7 cm in greatest dimension and invades the visceral pleura. This corresponds to a pathologic stage of pT2a.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):** The report states that two lymph nodes were examined and both were negative for metastatic carcinoma, which corresponds to pN0.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** There is no mention of distant metastasis, which implies M0.

Based on the AJCC 7th edition TNM staging system for lung cancer:
- T2a indicates a tumor size greater than 2 cm but less than or equal to 3 cm, or a tumor that invades the visceral pleura.
- N0 indicates no regional lymph node metastasis.
- M0 indicates no distant metastasis.

Combining these, the cancer is classified as Stage IB according to the AJCC 7th edition for lung cancer. However, since the options provided are generic stages, Stage IB falls under Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
5,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to consider the TNM classification provided in the pathology report:

1. **Primary Tumor (pT):** The report states ""pT1b: Tumor greater than 2 cm, but 3 cm or less in greatest dimension, surrounded by lung or visceral pleura, without bronchoscopic evidence of invasion more proximal than the lobar bronchus (i.e., not in the main bronchus)."" This indicates a T1b classification.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN):** The report indicates ""pN0: No regional lymph node metastasis."" This means there is no lymph node involvement.

3. **Distant Metastases (pM):** The report states ""Not applicable,"" which implies there are no distant metastases, corresponding to M0.

Based on the TNM classification:
- T1b
- N0
- M0

According to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer, a T1b N0 M0 classification corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
6,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the lung cancer from the pathology report, we need to consider the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and any distant metastasis.

1. **Tumor Size (T):** The report describes an invasive adenocarcinoma forming a 5 x 4 x 3 cm mass in the right lower lobe. According to AJCC staging, a tumor greater than 4 cm but less than or equal to 5 cm is classified as T2b.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N):** The report indicates that one of six intrapulmonary peribronchial lymph nodes is positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma. This suggests N1 involvement, which is defined as metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial and/or hilar lymph nodes and intrapulmonary nodes, including involvement by direct extension.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so we assume M0.

Based on the above information:
- T2b: Tumor size greater than 4 cm but less than or equal to 5 cm.
- N1: Metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial and/or hilar lymph nodes.
- M0: No distant metastasis.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system for lung cancer, a T2b N1 M0 classification corresponds to Stage IIB.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
7,"## Answer
The pathology report provides detailed information about the tumor and its characteristics. Let's break down the key points:

1. **Tumor Size and Location**: The tumor is located in the right lung lower lobe and measures 2.3 cm in greatest diameter. This size classifies it as T1b according to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report indicates that there is no metastatic carcinoma identified in the lymph nodes examined (0/2 in level 7, 0/3 in peribronchial, 0/1 in level 9, and 0/1 in level 4). This means there is no regional lymph node involvement, classifying it as N0.

3. **Distant Metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, which would classify it as M0.

4. **Visceral Pleural Invasion**: The carcinoma extends up to but not through the visceral pleura, which does not change the T classification.

5. **Final Pathologic Stage**: The report explicitly states the pathologic stage as pT1b N0, which corresponds to Stage I according to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
8,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to consider the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and any distant metastasis.

1. **Tumor Size (T):** The tumor is described as an invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with a size of 3.5 cm. According to AJCC staging, a tumor size of 3.5 cm would typically be classified as T2 (specifically T2a, as it is greater than 3 cm but 5 cm or less).

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N):** The report indicates metastatic adenocarcinoma involving 1 of 5 hilar lymph nodes. This suggests N1 involvement, as cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes but not to more distant nodes.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report. The presence of satellite tumor nodules in the pleura could suggest more advanced disease, but without explicit mention of distant metastasis, we assume M0.

Based on the above information:
- T2a (tumor size 3.5 cm)
- N1 (metastasis to 1 hilar lymph node)
- M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC staging system, a combination of T2a, N1, and M0 corresponds to Stage IIB.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
9,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information:

1. **Tumor Size and Location**: The tumor measures approximately 50 x 60 x 45 mm and is located in the left lower lobe of the lung. It abuts the pleural surface but does not invade it, as confirmed by special stains.

2. **Histological Type**: The tumor is a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma with a prominent mucinous bronchiolo-alveolar carcinoma component.

3. **Margins and Invasion**: The tumor is close to the bronchial resection margin but does not involve it. There is no vascular or perineural invasion.

4. **Lymph Nodes**: No metastases are found in the hilar lymph nodes.

5. **Staging Information**: The report provides a staging of T2N0Mx. 

- **T2** indicates a tumor size greater than 3 cm but less than or equal to 5 cm, or a tumor that involves the main bronchus without involvement of the carina, invades visceral pleura, or is associated with atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis that extends to the hilar region but does not involve the entire lung.
- **N0** indicates no regional lymph node metastasis.
- **Mx** indicates that distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Based on the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for lung cancer, a T2N0Mx classification corresponds to Stage I cancer, specifically Stage IB, as there is no lymph node involvement and no confirmed distant metastasis.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
10,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to consider the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and any distant metastasis.

1. **Tumor Size and Extent**: The tumor is 3 x 3 x 3 cm and involves the visceral pleura. According to AJCC, a tumor of this size and extent is typically classified as T2.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: There is 1 out of 1 lymph node positive for metastasis (intrathoracic). This indicates N1 involvement, as it involves ipsilateral intrathoracic lymph nodes.

3. **Distant Metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so we assume M0.

Based on the TNM classification:
- T2 (tumor size and pleural involvement)
- N1 (lymph node involvement)
- M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer:
- T2 N1 M0 corresponds to Stage IIB.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
11,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to consider the TNM classification provided in the pathology report:

1. **Tumor Size and Extent (T):** The report states ""pT2"". According to the AJCC staging system, T2 indicates a tumor size greater than 3 cm but 7 cm or less, or a tumor that involves the main bronchus, invades visceral pleura, or is associated with atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis that extends to the hilar region but does not involve the entire lung.

2. **Lymph Nodes (N):** The report states ""pN0 (0/20)"", which means there is no regional lymph node metastasis. N0 indicates that the cancer has not spread to nearby lymph nodes.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** The report states ""pMx"", which means that the presence of distant metastasis cannot be assessed. However, for staging purposes, if there is no evidence of metastasis, it is often considered as M0.

Given these factors:
- T2
- N0
- Mx (considered as M0 for staging purposes)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system for lung cancer:
- T2 N0 M0 corresponds to Stage IIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
12,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to consider the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and any distant metastasis.

1. **Tumor Size (T):** The tumor is 2.7 cm in diameter. According to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer, a tumor that is greater than 2 cm but less than or equal to 3 cm is classified as T1b.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N):** The pathology report indicates that there is metastatic adenocarcinoma in 1 out of 4 peribronchial lymph nodes. The other lymph nodes (R4 and station 11) show no metastatic carcinoma. Involvement of peribronchial lymph nodes corresponds to N1.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so we assume M0.

Based on the above information:
- T1b: Tumor size is greater than 2 cm but less than or equal to 3 cm.
- N1: Metastasis in peribronchial lymph nodes.
- M0: No distant metastasis.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system for lung cancer, a T1b N1 M0 classification corresponds to Stage IIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
13,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging:

1. **Tumor Size and Invasion**: The tumor is 1.2 cm in size and invades into, but not through, the visceral pleura. This corresponds to a T2 classification in the TNM staging system.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: A total of 7 lymph nodes were examined, and none were involved with cancer (0/7). This corresponds to an N0 classification.

3. **Distant Metastasis**: The report indicates pMX, meaning that distant metastasis cannot be assessed from the information provided.

Based on the TNM classification provided (pT2, pN0, pMX), we can determine the stage:

- **Stage I**: Typically involves T1 or T2 tumors with N0 and M0.
- **Stage II**: Involves T2 tumors with N1 or T3 tumors with N0.
- **Stage III**: Involves T1-T3 tumors with N2 or T4 tumors with any N.
- **Stage IV**: Involves any T, any N, and M1.

Given the information:
- The tumor is T2.
- There is no lymph node involvement (N0).
- Distant metastasis is not assessed (MX), but since there is no evidence of metastasis, we assume M0 for staging purposes.

Therefore, the cancer is best classified as Stage I, as it is a T2 tumor with no lymph node involvement and no evidence of distant metastasis.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
14,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging:

1. **Primary Tumor (T):** The tumor is described as adenocarcinoma, acinar type, grade III, measuring 4 cm, and invading the visceral pleura. This corresponds to a T2 classification, as it is more than 3 cm but less than or equal to 5 cm and involves the visceral pleura.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):** Metastatic adenocarcinoma is found in two of four lymph nodes, including level 7 lymph nodes. This indicates N2 classification, as it involves metastasis to ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** The report states Mx, meaning distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

According to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for lung cancer:

- **Stage III** is characterized by T1-T2, N2, M0 or T3, N1-N2, M0. Given the T2, N2, Mx classification, the cancer is consistent with Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
15,"## Answer
The pathology report provides detailed information about the tumor and lymph node involvement. Let's break down the key points:

1. **Tumor Size and Invasion**: The tumor is an invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, measuring 9.2 cm in greatest dimension, and it invades into the chest wall. This indicates a T3 classification according to the AJCC staging system, as the tumor is larger than 7 cm or invades the chest wall.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report indicates that there is no lymph node involvement. Specifically, 19 peribronchial lymph nodes and 6 mediastinal lymph nodes were examined, and all were negative for carcinoma. This corresponds to an N0 classification, meaning no regional lymph node metastasis.

3. **Distant Metastasis**: The report does not provide any information about distant metastasis (Mx), which means it is not assessed.

Based on the AJCC 7th Edition criteria, the pathological staging is pT3 N0 Mx. In the AJCC staging system for lung cancer:

- **Stage I**: T1-2 N0 M0
- **Stage II**: T1-2 N1 M0 or T3 N0 M0
- **Stage III**: T3 N1 M0 or T1-3 N2 M0
- **Stage IV**: Any T Any N M1

Given the classification of T3 N0 Mx, the cancer falls under Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is -

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
17,"## Answer
The provided text does not contain specific information about the tumor size, lymph node involvement, or metastasis, which are critical components for determining the AJCC stage of cancer. The text appears to be a set of instructions or a form template rather than an actual pathology report with diagnostic details. Without specific details such as T (tumor size), N (lymph node involvement), and M (metastasis) classifications, it is impossible to accurately determine the cancer stage.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Unknown""}"
18,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following information:

- The tumor is a well-differentiated papillary adenocarcinoma measuring 50 mm.
- The tumor extends to the visceral pleura but does not invade it.
- The bronchial resection level is tumor-free.
- Tumor classification is given as M-8140/3, G1, pT2, pN0, pMX.
- The report mentions ""stage I B"" and ""R 0"" (indicating no residual tumor).

According to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system:

- ""pT2"" indicates a tumor size greater than 3 cm but 5 cm or less, or a tumor that involves the main bronchus without involvement of the carina, invades visceral pleura, or is associated with atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis that extends to the hilar region but does not involve the entire lung.
- ""pN0"" indicates no regional lymph node metastasis.
- ""pMX"" indicates that distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

The report explicitly states ""stage I B,"" which corresponds to the AJCC staging for a tumor that is pT2, pN0, and pM0 (since pMX means metastasis cannot be assessed, but the report does not indicate any metastasis).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
19,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging:

1. **Tumor Size and Characteristics**: The tumor is 4.5 cm in size, located in the left upper lobe of the lung, and is an adenocarcinoma. It is poorly differentiated and unifocal. There is visceral pleural invasion and lymphovascular space invasion, but the tumor is confined to the lung.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: A total of six lymph nodes were examined, and one contained metastatic carcinoma. There is extracapsular extension with invasion of the adjacent artery wall.

3. **TNM Classification**: The report provides a pTNM stage of pT2aN1MX. This indicates:
   - **pT2a**: Tumor size is more than 3 cm but 5 cm or less, or tumor involves the main bronchus, invades visceral pleura, or is associated with atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis that extends to the hilar region but does not involve the entire lung.
   - **N1**: Metastasis in ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes and intrapulmonary nodes, including involvement by direct extension.
   - **MX**: Distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Based on the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for lung cancer, a classification of T2aN1 corresponds to Stage IIB. However, the presence of extracapsular extension and invasion of the adjacent artery wall suggests more advanced local disease, which is consistent with Stage IIIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
20,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to consider several factors from the pathology report, including tumor size, lymph node involvement, and metastasis. 

1. **Tumor Size**: The tumor size is given as 2.5 x 1.5 x 3 cm. According to the AJCC staging for lung cancer, a tumor size of 3 cm or less typically corresponds to T1.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report states ""Lymph nodes: Not specified."" Without information on lymph node involvement, we cannot assume any nodal metastasis (N0).

3. **Distant Metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so we assume M0.

4. **Histologic Type and Grade**: The histologic type is bronchiolo-alveolar adenocarcinoma, and it is poorly differentiated. While histologic grade can influence prognosis, it does not directly affect the AJCC staging.

5. **Other Factors**: The report does not specify tumor extent, lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, or margins, which are important for a more precise staging but are not provided here.

Based on the information provided, the tumor is small (T1), with no specified lymph node involvement (N0), and no distant metastasis (M0). This typically corresponds to Stage I lung cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"

The pathology report provides several key pieces of information that are crucial for determining the AJCC stage of the cancer:

1. **Tumor Size and Location**: The primary tumor is described as poorly differentiated with a size of 1.7 cm. It is located in the right upper lobe of the lung.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: There is metastatic carcinoma identified in multiple lymph nodes, including level 7, level 12, and R4. The report specifically mentions ""metastatic poorly differentiated with form of capsular penetration"" and ""metastatic adenocarcinoma to 2 cm peribronchial lymph node.""

3. **Distant Metastasis**: The report uses the designation ""MX,"" indicating that distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

4. **AJCC Staging Provided**: The report explicitly states ""AJCC pT1N2MX."" This indicates:
   - **pT1**: The primary tumor is 3 cm or less in greatest dimension.
   - **N2**: Metastasis to ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes.
   - **MX**: Distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Based on the AJCC 8th edition staging system for lung cancer:
- **Stage IIIA**: This stage includes T1 tumors with N2 lymph node involvement and no confirmed distant metastasis (MX).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
23,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to consider the primary tumor size, lymph node involvement, and any distant metastasis.

1. **Primary Tumor (T):** The report states that the tumor is an adenocarcinoma located in the right upper lobe of the lung, measuring 2.0 cm in its greatest dimension. According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor that is 2 cm or less in greatest dimension is classified as T1a.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):** The pathology report indicates that multiple lymph nodes from various levels (II, IV-R, VII, VIII, IX, XI) were excised and all were negative for malignancy. This is classified as N0, meaning no regional lymph node metastasis.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so we assume M0, indicating no distant metastasis.

Based on the TNM classification:
- T1a (tumor 2 cm or less)
- N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis)
- M0 (no distant metastasis)

The combination of T1a, N0, and M0 corresponds to Stage I according to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer.

24,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to consider the TNM classification provided in the pathology report:

1. **Tumor Size and Extent (T):** The report states ""pT2b"". According to the AJCC 8th edition for lung cancer, T2b indicates a tumor size greater than 5 cm but less than or equal to 7 cm, or a tumor that involves the main bronchus without involvement of the carina, invades visceral pleura, or is associated with atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis that extends to the hilar region but does not involve the entire lung.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):** The report states ""pN1 (6/28)"". N1 indicates metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes and intrapulmonary nodes, including involvement by direct extension.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** The report states ""pMx"", which means that the presence of distant metastasis cannot be assessed. However, for staging purposes, we typically assume M0 unless there is evidence of metastasis.

4. **Grade (G):** The report mentions ""G3"", indicating a high-grade tumor, but this does not directly affect the AJCC stage.

Based on the TNM classification:
- T2b
- N1
- M0 (assumed)

According to the AJCC 8th edition for lung cancer, a combination of T2b, N1, and M0 corresponds to Stage IIB.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
25,"## Answer
The pathology report provides detailed information about the cancer's characteristics and spread. Let's break down the key points:

1. **Primary Tumor (T):**
   - The larger tumor in the left upper lobe is described as invasive adenocarcinoma with a size of 5.0 x 4.1 x 2.4 cm. It invades into but not through the pleura, which classifies it as T2.
   - The smaller tumor in the left lower lobe is 1.0 cm, classified as T1.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):**
   - Multiple lymph nodes are positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma. Specifically, there is metastasis to lymph nodes in the left lung #6, left lung #10, and left lung AP window, with no extranodal extension.
   - The involvement of multiple lymph node stations, including N2 nodes (mediastinal or subcarinal nodes), indicates N2 classification.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):**
   - The report indicates MX, meaning distant metastasis cannot be assessed. However, there is no mention of confirmed distant metastasis.

Based on the AJCC staging system for lung cancer:
- T2, N2, MX corresponds to Stage IIIA.
- T1, N2, MX also corresponds to Stage IIIA.

The presence of N2 lymph node involvement without confirmed distant metastasis suggests that the cancer is locally advanced but not metastatic to distant organs.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
26,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging:

1. **Primary Tumor (T):** The tumor is located in the left upper lobe of the lung, is 3.5 cm in size, and is classified as invasive adenocarcinoma. The TNM classification given is pT2a. This indicates a tumor size greater than 3 cm but 5 cm or less, without invasion of the visceral pleura or main bronchus.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):** The report indicates that 2 of 2 peribronchial nodes are positive for metastatic tumor, and 1 hilar node is positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma. The TNM classification given is pN1, which indicates metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial and/or hilar lymph nodes.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** The report states pMX, meaning that distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Based on the TNM classification:
- **T2a** indicates a tumor size and characteristics that are consistent with Stage II or higher.
- **N1** indicates involvement of regional lymph nodes, which is consistent with Stage II or higher.
- **MX** means distant metastasis cannot be assessed, but there is no evidence provided of distant metastasis.

Given the combination of T2a and N1, the cancer is classified as Stage II according to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer, assuming no distant metastasis is present.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
27,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information:

1. **Tumor Size and Location**: The tumor is located in the left upper lobe and measures 3.5 x 2.8 x 2.5 cm.
2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: Metastatic adenocarcinoma is present in peribronchial lymph nodes and lymph nodes labeled 11L and #5, indicating N2 involvement.
3. **Margins and Invasion**: The tumor invades the visceral pleura, but the bronchial and vascular margins are negative.
4. **Pathologic Stage**: The report explicitly states the pathologic stage as pT2a N2 MX, which corresponds to Stage IIIA according to the AJCC staging system.

The AJCC staging system for lung cancer considers the size of the tumor (T), the involvement of lymph nodes (N), and the presence of metastasis (M). In this case, the tumor size and lymph node involvement (N2) are consistent with Stage IIIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
28,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information:

1. **Tumor Size and Invasion**: The tumor is a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma measuring 58 mm in maximum dimension. It invades through the visceral pleura and involves the chest wall fibrous connective tissue, but does not involve the rib bone or soft tissue resection margin.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: There is no evidence of lymph node metastases. Both hilar and peri-oesophageal lymph nodes show reactive changes only, with no malignancy.

3. **Distant Metastasis**: The report does not provide information on distant metastasis (MX).

4. **Staging Information**: The report provides a staging of T3N0MX. 

- **T3** indicates a tumor that is more than 5 cm but less than 7 cm, or a tumor that invades the chest wall, diaphragm, phrenic nerve, mediastinal pleura, or parietal pericardium, but not the rib bone.
- **N0** indicates no regional lymph node metastasis.
- **MX** indicates that distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Based on the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for lung cancer:
- **Stage IIIA** typically includes T3N0M0, T1-2N2M0, or T3N1M0.
- **Stage IIIB** includes T4N0-1M0 or T3N2M0.
- **Stage IIIC** includes any T with N3M0.
- **Stage IV** includes any M1.

Given the T3N0MX classification, the cancer is likely Stage IIB or Stage IIIA. However, since the options provided do not include Stage IIB, and considering the T3 classification with no lymph node involvement (N0), the most appropriate stage from the given options is Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
29,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following information:

- Tumor size: 6.00 cm
- Pathologic T stage: T2, NOS (Not Otherwise Specified)
- Pathologic N stage: N1
- Pathologic M stage: M0

According to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system:

- T2 indicates a tumor size greater than 3 cm but 7 cm or less, or a tumor that involves the main bronchus, invades visceral pleura, or is associated with atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis.
- N1 indicates metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes and intrapulmonary nodes, including involvement by direct extension.
- M0 indicates no distant metastasis.

Based on these criteria, the combination of T2, N1, and M0 corresponds to Stage II cancer in the AJCC staging system for lung cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
30,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information:

1. **Tumor Size**: The tumor is 3.5 x 3 cm.
2. **Histologic Type**: Adenocarcinoma, poorly differentiated (G-3).
3. **Lymph Nodes**: 0 out of 7 hilar lymph nodes are positive for metastasis, indicating no lymph node involvement.
4. **Venous Invasion**: Absent.
5. **Margins**: Uninvolved, meaning the tumor has been completely resected with no cancer cells at the margins.
6. **Tumor Extent**: Not specified, but no evidence of spread beyond the lung tissue is mentioned.

Based on the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for lung cancer:

- **Stage I**: Tumor is ≤4 cm, no lymph node involvement, and no distant metastasis.
- **Stage II**: Tumor may be larger or involve nearby structures, or there may be limited lymph node involvement.
- **Stage III**: More extensive local spread or significant lymph node involvement.
- **Stage IV**: Distant metastasis.

Given the tumor size (3.5 cm), absence of lymph node involvement (0/7), and no mention of distant metastasis or invasion into nearby structures, the cancer fits the criteria for Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
31,"## Answer
The pathology report provides detailed information about the cancer diagnosis and staging. Let's break down the key points:

1. **Tumor Characteristics**: 
   - The primary tumor is located in the right upper lobe of the lung.
   - There are separate tumor nodules in the same lobe, with the largest tumor measuring 3.7 cm in its greatest dimension.
   - The histologic type is adenocarcinoma, with no visceral pleural invasion or lymph-vascular invasion identified.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**:
   - A total of 11 lymph nodes were examined, and none were found to be involved with malignancy (0/11).

3. **Pathologic Staging**:
   - The report explicitly states the pathologic staging as Stage IIB, with a classification of pT3, pN0, and pM not applicable.
   - pT3 indicates a tumor greater than 5 cm or with separate tumor nodules in the same lobe, which aligns with the description of the tumor nodules in the report.
   - pN0 indicates no regional lymph node metastasis.
   - pM not applicable suggests no distant metastasis was assessed or found.

4. **AJCC Staging**:
   - According to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system, Stage IIB lung cancer is characterized by a T3 tumor with no lymph node involvement (N0) and no distant metastasis (M0).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
32,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging:

1. **Primary Tumor (T):** The tumor is greater than 3 cm in greatest dimension, which corresponds to T2.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):** There are metastases in ipsilateral peribronchial and ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes, which corresponds to N1.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** The report states MX, meaning distant metastasis cannot be assessed, but there is no evidence of distant metastasis provided in the report.

According to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for lung cancer:

- **Stage I** typically involves T1 or T2 tumors with N0 (no regional lymph node involvement) and M0 (no distant metastasis).
- **Stage II** involves T1 or T2 tumors with N1 (metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes) and M0.
- **Stage III** involves more extensive lymph node involvement (N2 or N3) or larger tumors (T3 or T4).
- **Stage IV** involves any T, any N, and M1 (distant metastasis present).

Given the information:
- The tumor is T2.
- There is N1 lymph node involvement.
- There is no evidence of distant metastasis (M0).

Therefore, the cancer is best classified as Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
33,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and presence of distant metastasis based on the pathology report.

1. **Primary Tumor (T):** The tumor is described as an adenocarcinoma measuring 2.5 cm in greatest dimension. There is a suggestion of visceral pleural invasion, but no direct extension of the tumor is identified. According to AJCC 8th edition, a tumor size of 2.5 cm with possible pleural invasion could be classified as T2a.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):** The report indicates that there is no evidence of metastasis in the lymph nodes examined (levels 7, 9, 11, and 12). Specifically, level 12 nodes show no metastasis in four nodes, level 7 shows no metastasis in seven nodes, and level 11 shows no metastasis in three nodes. This suggests a classification of N0, indicating no regional lymph node metastasis.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** The report states that distant metastasis cannot be evaluated by this specimen (pMX). However, there is no indication of distant metastasis in the provided information.

Based on the above evaluation:
- T2a (tumor size 2.5 cm with possible pleural invasion)
- N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis)
- M0 (no distant metastasis, as per available information)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system for lung cancer, a T2a, N0, M0 classification corresponds to Stage IB.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
34,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to consider the TNM classification provided in the pathology report:

1. **Primary Tumor (pT):** The tumor is described as measuring 3.5 cm in maximum dimension and is limited to the lung parenchyma but invades into the pleura. This is classified as pT2.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN):** The report states pNX, which means the regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed.

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM):** The report states pMX, indicating that distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Given the information:
- The tumor size and pleural invasion classify it as pT2.
- The lymph node status and distant metastasis are not assessed (pNX and pMX).

According to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer:
- Stage I typically involves smaller tumors (pT1) with no lymph node involvement (pN0) and no metastasis (pM0).
- Stage II can involve larger tumors (pT2) with no lymph node involvement (pN0) and no metastasis (pM0).
- Stage III involves more extensive local spread or lymph node involvement.
- Stage IV involves distant metastasis.

Since the tumor is pT2 and there is no information on lymph node involvement or metastasis (pNX and pMX), the most appropriate stage based on the available information is Stage II, assuming no lymph node involvement or metastasis.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
35,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information:

1. **Tumor Size and Invasion**: The tumor is 2.8 cm in size and is described as an invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with angiolymphatic and visceral pleural invasion.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: All sampled lymph nodes are benign, indicating no regional lymph node metastasis (N0).

3. **Metastasis**: The report states ""MX,"" which means distant metastasis cannot be assessed. However, there is no indication of distant metastasis in the report.

4. **Pathologic Stage**: The report explicitly states the pathologic stage as T2N0MX.

According to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for lung cancer:

- **T2**: Tumor size is more than 3 cm but 5 cm or less, or tumor involves the main bronchus, invades visceral pleura, or is associated with atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis that extends to the hilar region but does not involve the entire lung.
- **N0**: No regional lymph node metastasis.
- **M0/MX**: No distant metastasis or metastasis cannot be assessed.

For lung cancer, T2N0M0 corresponds to Stage IIA. However, since the metastasis status is MX (not assessed), we consider the information provided, which does not indicate any distant metastasis. Therefore, the most appropriate stage based on the given information is Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
36,"## Answer
The pathology report provides several key pieces of information that are relevant for staging the cancer according to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) guidelines:

1. **Tumor Size and Location**: The tumor is located in the middle lobe of the right lung and measures 5.5 x 5.0 cm. This size typically corresponds to a T2 classification, as it is greater than 3 cm but less than 7 cm.

2. **Tumor Extension**: The tumor extends into the fissure, which may suggest a more advanced T classification, but it does not invade the visceral pleura (negative for visceral pleural invasion).

3. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report mentions several lymph nodes (inferior pulmonary ligament, periesophageal, subcarinal, paratracheal, proximal) but states that twelve lymph nodes are negative for carcinoma. This suggests no regional lymph node involvement, which would be classified as N0.

4. **Distant Metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, which would be classified as M0.

5. **Histologic Grade**: The tumor is poorly differentiated (G3), which indicates a more aggressive tumor but does not directly affect the AJCC stage.

Based on the information provided:
- The tumor size and extension suggest a T2 classification.
- The absence of lymph node involvement suggests an N0 classification.
- The absence of distant metastasis suggests an M0 classification.

Combining these, the pathologic stage would be T2N0M0, which corresponds to Stage II according to the AJCC staging system for non-small cell lung cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
37,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to consider the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and metastasis based on the provided pathology report.

1. **Tumor Size (T):** The report indicates a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with clear cell changes measuring 7 cm in the right lung. According to AJCC staging for lung cancer, a tumor greater than 5 cm but less than or equal to 7 cm is classified as T2b.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N):** The report states that there is no tumor seen in multiple lymph nodes examined, including mediastinal, right level 4, level 7, and peribronchial lymph nodes. This indicates N0, meaning no regional lymph node metastasis.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so we assume M0, indicating no distant metastasis.

Based on the above information:
- T2b (tumor size 5-7 cm)
- N0 (no regional lymph node involvement)
- M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system for lung cancer, a T2bN0M0 classification corresponds to Stage IIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
38,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging:

1. **Primary Tumor (T):** The tumor is classified as pT2a, which indicates a tumor more than 3 cm but 5 cm or less in greatest dimension.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):** The report indicates pN1, which means there is metastasis in ipsilateral peribronchial lymph nodes. Specifically, metastatic carcinoma is found in 3 of 18 lymph nodes.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, suggesting M0.

According to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for lung cancer:

- **Stage I** typically involves T1 or T2a tumors with N0 (no regional lymph node involvement).
- **Stage II** involves T1 or T2a tumors with N1 (metastasis in ipsilateral peribronchial or hilar lymph nodes).
- **Stage III** involves more advanced T or N categories, such as T3 or N2.
- **Stage IV** involves any T, any N, and M1 (distant metastasis).

Given the classification of pT2a and pN1, with no distant metastasis (M0), the cancer corresponds to **Stage II**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
