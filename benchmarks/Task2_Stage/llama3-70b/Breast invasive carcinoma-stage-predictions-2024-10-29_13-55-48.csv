Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC Stage of the Cancer.

1. The report mentions ""pT4b"", which indicates the primary tumor (T) is at least 5 cm in size and has extended to the chest wall or skin, which is a characteristic of a T4 tumor.

2. The report also mentions ""pN1a (1/11)"", which indicates that one or more axillary lymph nodes are involved, but not more than three. This is a characteristic of an N1 tumor.

3. There is no mention of distant metastases, so the M category is ""pMx"", which means the presence of distant metastases cannot be assessed.

4. Based on the T and N categories, we can determine the overall stage. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T4 tumor with N1 nodal involvement corresponds to Stage III.

5. The report specifically mentions ""stage III B"" and ""R1"", which indicates that the tumor has been resected but with microscopic residual tumor (R1).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III B""}"

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC Stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions the diagnosis as Infiltrative ductal carcinoma, which is a type of breast cancer.
2. The T Stage is 2, which means the tumor is larger than 2 cm but not larger than 5 cm in greatest dimension.
3. The N Stage is 0, indicating that there is no regional lymph node metastasis.
4. The M Stage is 0, indicating that there is no distant metastasis.

Based on the TNM staging system, a T2N0M0 corresponds to Stage II breast cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
2,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC Stage of the Cancer.

1. The diagnosis mentions a multifocal poorly differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma with three tumor foci of sizes 7 cm, 2.2 cm, and 1.7 cm. This indicates a large tumor size, which is a key factor in determining the T stage.

2. The report states ""pT4b(mult)"" which corresponds to the T stage. According to the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, T4b is defined as a tumor of any size with extension to the chest wall and/or to the skin (ulceration or satellite nodules). The ""(mult)"" suffix indicates multifocality, which does not affect the T stage.

3. The N stage is denoted by ""N3a"", which corresponds to metastases in ipsilateral infraclavicular (level III axillary) lymph nodes.

4. The report does not mention any distant metastases, so the M stage is M0.

5. Combining the T, N, and M stages, we get pT4bN3aM0, which corresponds to Stage III according to the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
3,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor (pT) is classified as pT2(m), which means the tumor is larger than 2 cm but not larger than 5 cm in greatest dimension. This is based on the two foci of invasive lobular carcinoma, measuring 1.9 cm and 2.2 cm.

2. The lymph nodes (pN) are classified as pNO(sn), which means no regional lymph node metastases are present. This is based on the fact that 0 out of 4 sentinel lymph nodes are positive for cancer.

3. The metastasis (pM) is classified as pMX, which means distant metastases cannot be assessed.

Based on the pT, pN, and pM classifications, we can determine the overall AJCC stage. Since the primary tumor is larger than 2 cm but not larger than 5 cm, and there are no regional lymph node metastases, the tumor is classified as Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
4,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is described as a moderately differentiated infiltrating ductal carcinoma, measuring 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm, with a microscopic distance of 2.6 cm. This corresponds to a T2 tumor (T1: ≤ 2 cm, T2: > 2 cm but ≤ 5 cm).

2. The tumor extends to within 0.8 cm of the medial margin and 0.7 cm from both the superficial and deep margins, but the margins are not involved. This does not affect the T stage.

3. The lymph node status is critical in determining the N stage. Sentinel lymph node #1 is negative for metastatic disease, but sentinel lymph node #2 contains an isolated tumor cell cluster, 0.1 mm, in a capsular lymphatic space. This corresponds to an N1mi tumor (micrometastasis in 1-3 lymph nodes).

4. There is no evidence of distant metastases (M0).

Based on the TNM staging system, the patient's cancer can be classified as T2N1miM0. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, this corresponds to Stage IIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IIA""}"
5,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor size is 0.9 cm, which corresponds to a T1b stage (T stage, pathologic: pT1b).
2. There is no lymph node involvement (LYMPH NODES POSITIVE: 0, LYMPH NODES EXAMINED: 2), which corresponds to an N0 stage (N stage, pathologic: pNO).
3. There is no mention of distant metastases, and the M stage is reported as pMX, which means it is unknown or cannot be assessed. However, in the absence of any evidence of distant metastases, we can assume it is M0.
4. Combining the T, N, and M stages, we get: T1b, N0, M0.

According to the AJCC staging system, a T1b, N0, M0 corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
6,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can see that:

1. The tumor size is at least 3 cm in greatest dimension, which corresponds to T2.
2. Lymphovascular invasion is identified, which is a negative prognostic factor.
3. Metastatic carcinoma is present in two of twenty-one lymph nodes, which corresponds to N1.

There is no evidence of distant metastasis (M0).

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2 tumor with N1 lymph node involvement corresponds to Stage IIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IIA""}"
7,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Primary tumor (T): The report states that the invasive carcinoma measures 6 mm (main lesion) and 3.2 mm (satellite). According to the AJCC 7th edition, a tumor size of ≤ 2 cm is classified as T1. Since the main lesion is 6 mm, it falls within the T1 category. The modifier ""b"" indicates that the tumor is > 2 mm but ≤ 5 mm, and the ""(m)"" suffix indicates that there are multiple tumors.

2. Regional lymph nodes (N): The report states that the axillary sentinel nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma (0/2). This corresponds to N0, indicating no regional lymph node metastases.

3. Distant metastases (M): The report does not mention any distant metastases, so it is classified as Mx, which means distant metastases cannot be assessed.

Now, let's combine the T, N, and M categories to determine the overall stage. According to the AJCC 7th edition, a T1 tumor with N0 nodes and Mx distant metastases corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
8,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The tumor size is 1.8 cm in largest dimension (T1).
* There is no lymph node involvement (N0) as all sentinel and non-sentinel lymph nodes are benign.
* There is no distant metastasis (M0) as there is no evidence of tumor in the right breast or any other distant sites.

According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a size of 1.8 cm (T1), no lymph node involvement (N0), and no distant metastasis (M0) corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage I}"
9,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Tumor size**: The tumor size is 3.0 cm, which is a significant factor in determining the T stage. According to the AJCC 8th edition, a tumor size of 3.0 cm corresponds to a T2 stage.

2. **Lymphovascular space invasion**: The report mentions lymphovascular space invasion, which is a negative prognostic factor. However, it does not provide information about lymph node involvement, which is crucial for determining the N stage.

3. **Tumor extension to the deep surgical margin**: The tumor extends to within 1 mm of the deep surgical margin, which may indicate a higher risk of local recurrence. However, this factor is not directly related to the AJCC staging system.

4. **No information about lymph node involvement**: The report does not provide information about lymph node involvement, which is essential for determining the N stage.

5. **No distant metastases mentioned**: There is no mention of distant metastases in the report, which suggests that the M stage is likely M0.

Based on the available information, we can determine the T stage as T2 (tumor size 3.0 cm). However, we cannot determine the N stage due to the lack of information about lymph node involvement. Therefore, we cannot assign a definitive AJCC stage.

However, considering the T2 stage and the absence of distant metastases, the most likely stage would be Stage II (T2, Nx, M0).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
10,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions that the patient underwent a left simple mastectomy and sentinel node biopsy. The sentinel lymph nodes (#1 and #2) are negative for tumor (0/1 and 0/1, respectively).
2. The left breast mastectomy specimen shows an intraductal apocrine ductal carcinoma with lobular cancerization and rare foci of invasion (largest focus 3mm). There is also a separate mass of intraductal and infiltrating ductal carcinoma (2.5 cm) inferior to the hemorrhagic region.
3. The breast pathologic parameters indicate that the invasive carcinoma measures 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm, with a composite histologic grade of III.
4. The excisional biopsy margins are free of tumor, with margins greater than 2mm away.
5. There is no blood vessel or lymphatic invasion.
6. The axillary lymph nodes are negative for tumor (0/2).
7. The pTNM staging is pT2, N0, MX.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* The primary tumor (pT) is stage T2, as the invasive carcinoma measures 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm.
* The lymph nodes (N) are stage N0, as the sentinel lymph nodes and axillary lymph nodes are negative for tumor.
* The metastasis (M) is stage MX, as there is no evidence of distant metastasis.

Therefore, the AJCC stage is Stage II (T2, N0, MX).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
11,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Primary tumor (T): The tumor size is 3.5 x 2.5 x 1.7 cm, and it involves the posterior resection margin, inferior resection margin, and comes close to the anterior resection margin. This corresponds to a pT2 tumor.

2. Lymph nodes (N): Three out of 28 lymph nodes are positive for metastatic disease, with extracapsular extension (0.2 cm). This corresponds to a pN1a lymph node stage.

3. Distant metastases (M): There is no evidence of distant metastases in the report, so the M stage is pMX (cannot be assessed).

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a pT2 tumor with pN1a lymph nodes and pMX distant metastases corresponds to Stage IIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IIA""}"
12,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC Stage of the Cancer.

1. The diagnosis is bifocal poorly differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma, which means there are two tumor foci.
2. The tumor diameters are 2.5 cm and 0.7 cm, indicating that the larger tumor is greater than 2 cm in size.
3. The tumor classification is NOS (Not Otherwise Specified), G III (Grade 3, poorly differentiated), pT2 (tumor size >2 cm but ≤5 cm), mult (multiple tumors), NO (no regional lymph node metastasis), sn (sentinel lymph node biopsy), LO (lymphovascular invasion not identified), VORO (no vascular invasion or orificial invasion).

Based on the pT2 classification, the primary tumor is larger than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm. There is no regional lymph node metastasis (NO), and no distant metastasis is mentioned in the report.

According to the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, a tumor with a size >2 cm but ≤5 cm and no regional lymph node metastasis corresponds to Stage II.

15,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor size is 2.2 x 1.6 x 1.6 cm, which corresponds to pT2 according to the AJCC staging system.
2. There is no ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) present.
3. Angiolymphatic invasion is absent.
4. The surgical resection margins are negative for tumor, indicating that the tumor has not invaded the margins.
5. The lymph nodes, specifically the right axillary sentinel lymph nodes, are negative for metastatic carcinoma, which corresponds to pNO (i-) (sn).

Based on these findings, we can determine the T, N, and M stages as follows:

* T stage: pT2 (tumor size 2.2 x 1.6 x 1.6 cm)
* N stage: pNO (i-) (sn) (no lymph node metastasis)
* M stage: Not mentioned in the report, but since there is no mention of distant metastasis, we can assume M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a T2 stage, N0 stage, and M0 stage corresponds to Stage II.

{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
16,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor size is 1.3 cm x 1.2 cm x 1.0 cm, which is less than 2 cm in greatest dimension. According to the AJCC staging system, this corresponds to T1.
2. The report mentions that one of the 23 right axillary lymph nodes has metastatic carcinoma with extracapsular extension. This indicates that the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes, specifically N2.
3. There is no mention of distant metastases in the report, so M0.

Based on the TNM classification, the patient's cancer stage is:

T1 (tumor size < 2 cm)
N2 (metastasis in 1-3 axillary lymph nodes with extracapsular extension)
M0 (no distant metastases)

According to the AJCC staging system, this corresponds to Stage III.

17,"## Answer

From the pathology report, we can identify the following key features:

1. The tumor size is 3.0 cm (pT2).
2. There is one lymph node involved by metastatic mammary carcinoma (9 mm) and one lymph node involved by micrometastatic mammary carcinoma (1 mm) (N1a).

According to the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, the TNM stage is determined by the primary tumor (T), regional lymph nodes (N), and distant metastases (M). In this case, the TNM stage is pT2 N1a.

Based on the TNM stage, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* pT2 indicates a tumor size between 2.0 cm and 5.0 cm.
* N1a indicates that one to three axillary lymph nodes are involved by metastatic cancer.

Therefore, the AJCC stage is Stage II.

2. The report mentions ""pT3NOLOVORO"", which indicates the tumor classification:
   - pT3: Primary tumor is 9 cm in diameter (as mentioned earlier).
   - N0: No regional lymph node metastasis.
   - L0: No lymphovascular invasion.
   - V0: No venous invasion.
   - R0: Resection margins are tumor-free (as mentioned in the report).

3. Based on the TNM classification, the patient has a T3 tumor (large tumor size) with no lymph node metastasis (N0) and no distant metastasis (not mentioned in the report, but assumed to be M0 since it's not mentioned).

4. According to the AJCC Stage grouping, a T3N0M0 tumor corresponds to Stage III.

20,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor (T) is described as an invasive ductal carcinoma measuring 1.5 cm in greatest dimension, located in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. This corresponds to a T1 tumor (T1: tumor ≤ 2 cm in greatest dimension).

2. The lymph nodes (N) are described as having a single keratin-positive cell suspicious for an isolated tumor cell in one lymph node (out of two sentinel lymph nodes). This corresponds to an N0(i+) tumor (N0(i+): no regional lymph node metastases, but with isolated tumor cells).

3. There is no mention of distant metastases (M) in the report, so we can assume M0 (no distant metastases).

Based on the TNM classification, the AJCC stage is determined as follows:

* T1 (primary tumor ≤ 2 cm)
* N0(i+) (isolated tumor cells in one lymph node)
* M0 (no distant metastases)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, this corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
21,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The tumor size is 2.0 cm, 1.9 cm, and 1.1 cm in maximum dimension, which corresponds to T2 (tumor > 2 cm but ≤ 5 cm).
* There is perineural invasion, but it does not affect the T stage.
* The tumor is close to the medial margin (0.1 cm), deep margin (1 mm), and anterior margin (2 mm), but there is no evidence of tumor at the margins.
* There is metastatic adenocarcinoma in one of one sentinel lymph node (1/1), with a maximum size of 0.3 cm, and extranodal extension is not identified.
* There is also metastatic adenocarcinoma in one of one palpable lymph node (1/1), with a maximum size of 0.9 cm, and extranodal extension is present, measuring 0.1 cm in maximum dimension.
* Additionally, there is metastatic adenocarcinoma in three of thirty-one lymph nodes (3/31), with a maximum size of 0.4 cm, and extranodal extension is present, measuring 0.5 mm in maximum dimension.

Based on the lymph node involvement, we can see that there are multiple lymph nodes involved, with extranodal extension present in some of them. This corresponds to N3 (metastases in 10 or more axillary lymph nodes, or in clinically apparent internal mammary lymph nodes in the absence of axillary lymph node metastases).

Since there is no evidence of distant metastasis, the M stage is M0.

Therefore, the AJCC stage of the cancer is Stage III (T2, N3, M0).

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can gather the following information:

* Tumor size: The invasive carcinoma involves an area of approximately 8.5 cm in the lateral aspect of the left breast.
* Lymph node involvement: There is metastatic carcinoma in one sentinel lymph node (7.0 mm in greatest microscopic dimension) with extranodal extension (2.0 mm in greatest dimension). Additionally, there are metastases in nine of twenty-one lymph nodes in the left axillary contents, with the largest lymph node metastasis measuring 5.0 mm in greatest microscopic dimension. Focal extranodal extension is also present.
* Distant metastasis: There is no evidence of distant metastasis in the report.

Based on the AJCC staging system, a tumor size of 8.5 cm corresponds to T3. The presence of metastases in multiple lymph nodes (N2) and extranodal extension further supports a higher stage.

31,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor (pT) is classified as pT3, which means the tumor is greater than 5 cm in size (9.2 x 4.2 x 3.2 cm).

2. The report states that the tumor does not involve the nipple, skin, or underlying chest wall, which rules out pT4.

3. The sentinel lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma, which is classified as pN0 (i-).

4. There is no mention of distant metastases, which would be classified as M1.

According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a pT3 primary tumor and pN0 lymph nodes would be classified as Stage IIA or Stage IIIA, depending on the presence of other factors.

34,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor size is 4.3 x 2.3 x 2.7 cm, which corresponds to a T2 tumor (T1: ≤ 2 cm, T2: > 2 cm but ≤ 5 cm, T3: > 5 cm).
2. The tumor has invaded the axillary lymph nodes (Metastases carcinomatosae in lymphonodis axillae, No II/XVII), which corresponds to an N1a lymph node status (N1a: Metastases in 1-3 axillary lymph nodes).
3. There is no mention of distant metastases (M0).
4. Combining the T and N stages, we get a stage of at least II (T2N1a).

Considering the above points, the patient's cancer stage is likely Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
35,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The tumor is multicentric in situ and infiltrating lobular carcinoma, spanning a gross distance of 7.0 cm from medial to lateral in the superior central portion of the specimen, with a distinct and separate 1.0-cm nodule. This indicates a tumor size of T3 (>5 cm).
* The lymph nodes are negative for metastatic disease, with no evidence of tumor involvement in the sentinel lymph nodes (Parts A, B, E, F, and G).
* There is no evidence of distant metastasis.

According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor size of T3 with no lymph node involvement and no distant metastasis corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"

37,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions a ""moderately differentiated infiltrating lobular carcinoma"" in the left breast, which indicates an invasive carcinoma.
2. The tumor size is not explicitly stated, but we can infer it from the gross description: ""a 3.2 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm tumor centrally extending into the upper inner quadrant."" This suggests a tumor size of approximately 3.2 cm in greatest dimension.
3. The report mentions that the tumor extends into the skin of the nipple and involves the upper outer quadrant, but does not involve the deep surgical margin. This indicates skin involvement, which is a key factor in staging.
4. There is no mention of lymph node involvement or distant metastases.

Based on the above information, we can determine the T stage (primary tumor) as T4, due to the skin involvement. The N stage (lymph nodes) is NX, as there is no information about lymph node involvement. The M stage (distant metastases) is M0, as there is no evidence of distant metastases.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T4 tumor with NX lymph nodes and M0 distant metastases corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is -

71,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor (pT) is classified as pT1c, which corresponds to a tumor size of 1-2 cm in greatest dimension. This is a relatively small tumor.

2. There is no angiolymphatic invasion identified, which suggests that the tumor has not invaded the lymphatic or blood vessels.

3. The surgical resection margins are negative for tumor, indicating that the tumor has been completely removed.

4. However, the lymph nodes (pN) are classified as pN1, which means that 1-3 axillary lymph nodes are positive for metastatic carcinoma. In this case, 3 out of 25 lymph nodes are positive, and there is extranodal extension.

According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a size of 1-2 cm (pT1c) and 1-3 positive lymph nodes (pN1) corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
72,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The tumor size is 2.7 cm (pT2), which falls into the T2 category.
* There is no metastatic carcinoma identified in three out of four sentinel lymph nodes (0/1, 0/1, and 0/1). However, there is an isolated tumor cell cluster (ITC) identified in one lymph node (pN0(i+)), which indicates minimal lymph node involvement.
* There is no evidence of distant metastasis (pMx).

Based on the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a size of 2.7 cm (T2) and minimal lymph node involvement (N0(i+)) would fall into Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the Cancer.

1. The diagnosis mentions ""bifocal poorly differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma"", which indicates that there are two separate tumor foci.

2. The tumor diameters are 2.8 cm and 0.8 cm, which suggests that the larger tumor is greater than 2 cm in size.

3. The concluding tumor classification is ""NOS, G III, pT2(mult)NOLOVORO"". 
   - ""NOS"" stands for ""Not Otherwise Specified"", which is a term used to describe a tumor that does not fit into a specific category.
   - ""G III"" indicates that the tumor is poorly differentiated (Grade III).
   - ""pT2"" indicates that the primary tumor is larger than 2 cm but not larger than 5 cm in greatest dimension.
   - ""(mult)"" suggests that the tumor is multifocal, which is consistent with the bifocal diagnosis.
   - ""NO"" indicates that there is no regional lymph node involvement.
   - ""LO"" and ""VO"" are not relevant for staging.
   - ""RO"" suggests that there is no distant metastasis.

4. Based on the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a size greater than 2 cm but not larger than 5 cm (pT2) and no regional lymph node involvement (NO) corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
74,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the primary tumor (T), regional lymph nodes (N), and distant metastasis (M).

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The primary tumor (T) is classified as pT3, which means the tumor is greater than 5 cm in size.
* The regional lymph nodes (N) are classified as pNO, which means no regional lymph node metastases are present.
* There is no mention of distant metastasis (M), so we can assume it is MX (cannot be assessed).

According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a primary tumor size greater than 5 cm (pT3) and no regional lymph node metastases (pNO) would be classified as Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is -
