The pathology report provides detailed information about the lung cancer diagnosis. Let's break down the key elements relevant to staging:

1. **Primary Tumor (pT):** The report indicates a pT2a classification. This means the tumor is greater than 3 cm but 5 cm or less in greatest dimension, surrounded by lung or visceral pleura without bronchoscopic evidence of invasion more proximal than the lobar bronchus.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN):** The report states pN0, indicating no regional lymph node metastasis. All lymph nodes examined (levels 5, 7, and 9) were negative for carcinoma.

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM):** The report mentions ""Not applicable"" for distant metastasis, implying no evidence of distant spread.

4. **Multiple Primary Tumors:** The report notes the presence of synchronous carcinomas in the lingula and left lower lobe, but they are considered separate primaries rather than metastatic spread.

Based on the AJCC staging system for lung cancer:
- A pT2a tumor with pN0 and no distant metastasis (pM0) typically corresponds to Stage IB.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
1,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging:

1. **Tumor Size and Characteristics**: The tumor is an adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated, located in the subpleural right lower lung lobe, with a size of 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.6 cm. It shows pleural invasion but no lymphovascular space invasion.

2. **Lymph Node Status**: All lymph nodes examined (R lymph node, L lymph node, Station 11, Station 12, and Station 7) are negative for neoplasm, indicating no regional lymph node involvement.

3. **Staging Information**: The report explicitly states the stage as T2N0. According to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for lung cancer:
   - T2 indicates a tumor size greater than 3 cm but less than or equal to 5 cm, or a tumor with certain features such as invasion into the visceral pleura.
   - N0 indicates no regional lymph node metastasis.

Based on the T2N0 classification, the cancer is classified as Stage I. Specifically, T2N0 corresponds to Stage IB in the AJCC 8th edition for lung cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
2,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging:

1. **Primary Tumor (pT):** The tumor is classified as pT1b, which indicates a tumor size greater than 2 cm but 3 cm or less in greatest dimension.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN):** The report indicates pN1, meaning there is metastasis in ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes and intrapulmonary nodes, including involvement by direct extension.

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM):** The report states pMX, which means distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

According to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for lung cancer:

- **Stage I** typically involves pT1 or pT2 with pN0 (no regional lymph node involvement).
- **Stage II** involves pT1 or pT2 with pN1 (regional lymph node involvement).
- **Stage III** involves more extensive lymph node involvement (pN2 or pN3) or larger tumors (pT3 or pT4).
- **Stage IV** involves distant metastasis (pM1).

Given the information:
- The tumor is pT1b.
- There is regional lymph node involvement (pN1).
- Distant metastasis is not assessed (pMX).

The combination of pT1b and pN1 corresponds to **Stage II** lung cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
3,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging:

1. **Tumor Size and Extent (T):** The tumor is described as a moderately-poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with a maximum size of 2.5 x 2.0 cm. The extent of invasion is classified as pT1, indicating a small tumor size with limited local invasion.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):** The report indicates pN2, meaning there is involvement of ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes. Specifically, ten out of twelve lymph nodes are involved by metastatic carcinoma, including the subcarinal lymph node.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** The report states pMX, which means distant metastasis cannot be assessed. However, there is no indication of confirmed distant metastasis.

Based on the AJCC staging system for lung cancer:
- **Stage I** typically involves a small tumor (T1) with no lymph node involvement (N0) and no distant metastasis (M0).
- **Stage II** involves a larger tumor or limited lymph node involvement (N1) but no distant metastasis (M0).
- **Stage III** involves more extensive lymph node involvement (N2 or N3) and no distant metastasis (M0).
- **Stage IV** involves any T, any N, and confirmed distant metastasis (M1).

Given the pT1 classification, pN2 lymph node involvement, and no confirmed distant metastasis (pMX), the cancer is best classified as Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
4,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging the cancer:

1. **Primary Tumor (T):** The tumor is described as an invasive poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma measuring 2.7 cm in greatest dimension and invades the visceral pleura. This corresponds to a pathologic stage of pT2a according to the AJCC 7th edition, as it is greater than 2 cm but less than or equal to 3 cm and involves the visceral pleura.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):** The report states ""Regional lymph nodes pNO,"" indicating that there is no regional lymph node involvement. Two lymph nodes were examined and found negative for metastatic carcinoma.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** The report mentions ""Distant metastasis: Not applicable,"" which implies there is no evidence of distant metastasis.

Based on the TNM classification:
- T2a: Tumor size and pleural invasion.
- N0: No regional lymph node involvement.
- M0: No distant metastasis.

According to the AJCC staging system, a combination of T2a, N0, and M0 corresponds to Stage IIA for non-small cell lung cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
5,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging the cancer according to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) guidelines:

1. **Primary Tumor (pT):** The tumor is classified as pT1b, which indicates a tumor greater than 2 cm but 3 cm or less in greatest dimension, surrounded by lung or visceral pleura, without bronchoscopic evidence of invasion more proximal than the lobar bronchus.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN):** The report states pN0, meaning there is no regional lymph node metastasis. All sampled lymph nodes (levels 4, 7, and 10) are negative for carcinoma.

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM):** The report indicates that distant metastasis is not applicable, which typically means there is no evidence of distant metastasis.

Based on the TNM classification:
- T1b indicates a small tumor size.
- N0 indicates no lymph node involvement.
- M0 (implied by ""not applicable"") indicates no distant metastasis.

Combining these factors, the cancer is classified as Stage I according to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer, which is characterized by a small tumor size with no lymph node involvement or distant metastasis.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
6,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to consider the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and any distant metastasis.

1. **Tumor Size (T):** The report describes an invasive adenocarcinoma forming a 5 x 4 x 3 cm mass in the right lower lobe. This size typically corresponds to T2 (tumor more than 3 cm but 5 cm or less in greatest dimension).

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N):** The report indicates that one of six intrapulmonary peribronchial lymph nodes is positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma. This suggests N1 involvement, which means metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial and/or hilar lymph nodes and intrapulmonary nodes, including involvement by direct extension.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so we assume M0 (no distant metastasis).

Based on the TNM classification:
- T2 (tumor size)
- N1 (lymph node involvement)
- M0 (no distant metastasis)

The combination of T2, N1, and M0 corresponds to Stage II cancer according to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
7,"## Answer
The pathology report provides detailed information about the lung adenocarcinoma. Let's break down the key points relevant to staging:

1. **Tumor Size and Invasion**: The tumor is 2.3 cm in greatest diameter, which corresponds to a T1b classification (tumor size >2 cm but ≤3 cm). The carcinoma extends up to but not through the visceral pleura, indicating no pleural invasion beyond the visceral pleura.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report indicates that there is no metastatic carcinoma identified in the lymph nodes examined (0/2 in level 7, 0/3 in peribronchial, 0/1 in level 9, and 0/1 in level 4). This corresponds to an N0 classification, meaning no regional lymph node metastasis.

3. **Distant Metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, which corresponds to an M0 classification.

Based on the TNM classification provided in the report (pT1b N0 M0), the cancer is staged as Stage I according to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer. Stage I is characterized by a small tumor size with no lymph node involvement or distant metastasis.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
8,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to consider the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and presence of metastasis.

1. **Tumor Size (T):** The tumor is described as an invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with a size of 3.5 cm. According to AJCC staging, a tumor size of 3.5 cm would typically be classified as T2a (tumor >3 cm but ≤5 cm).

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N):** The report indicates metastatic adenocarcinoma involving 1 of 5 hilar lymph nodes. This suggests N1 involvement, as N1 indicates metastasis in ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes and intrapulmonary nodes, including involvement by direct extension.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report. The presence of satellite tumor nodules in the pleura does not necessarily indicate distant metastasis, as they are considered part of the primary tumor's local spread.

Based on the information provided:
- T2a (tumor size 3.5 cm)
- N1 (metastasis in 1 hilar lymph node)
- M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer, a T2a, N1, M0 classification corresponds to Stage IIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
9,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information:

1. **Tumor Size and Location**: The tumor measures approximately 50 x 60 x 45 mm and is located in the left lower lobe of the lung. It is described as a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma with a prominent mucinous bronchiolo-alveolar carcinoma component.

2. **Pleural Involvement**: The tumor closely abuts the pleural surface, but special stains confirm that there is no pleural invasion.

3. **Lymph Node Involvement**: There is no evidence of metastasis to the hilar lymph nodes.

4. **Vascular and Perineural Invasion**: No vascular or perineural invasion is observed.

5. **Resection Margins**: The bronchial resection margin is free of tumor.

6. **Staging Information**: The report provides a staging of T2N0Mx. 

   - **T2**: Tumor size is greater than 3 cm but less than or equal to 5 cm, or it involves the main bronchus without involvement of the carina, or invades visceral pleura, or is associated with atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis that extends to the hilar region but does not involve the entire lung.
   - **N0**: No regional lymph node metastasis.
   - **Mx**: Distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Based on the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for lung cancer:

- **Stage I**: T1-2, N0, M0
- **Stage II**: T2b-3, N0, M0 or T1-2, N1, M0
- **Stage III**: T1-2, N2, M0 or T3, N0-1, M0
- **Stage IV**: Any T, Any N, M1

Given the information, the tumor is classified as T2N0Mx, which corresponds to Stage I when considering the absence of lymph node involvement (N0) and no evidence of distant metastasis (Mx, but assuming M0 for staging purposes).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
10,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the lung cancer from the pathology report, we need to consider the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and any distant metastasis.

1. **Tumor Size and Extent**: The tumor is 3 x 3 x 3 cm and involves the visceral pleura. According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor of this size (≤4 cm) that invades the visceral pleura is classified as T2.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report indicates that there is 1 out of 1 lymph node positive for metastasis (intrathoracic). This suggests N1 involvement, which means metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes and intrapulmonary nodes, including involvement by direct extension.

3. **Distant Metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so we assume M0.

Combining these factors:
- T2 (tumor size and pleural involvement)
- N1 (lymph node involvement)
- M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system for lung cancer, a T2, N1, M0 classification corresponds to Stage IIB.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
11,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to consider the TNM classification provided in the pathology report:

1. **Tumor size and extent (T):** The report states ""pT2"". According to AJCC guidelines, T2 indicates a tumor size greater than 3 cm but less than or equal to 5 cm, or a tumor that involves the main bronchus or invades the visceral pleura. The tumor size here is 4.0 cm, and there is infiltration of the pleura visceralis, which fits the criteria for T2.

2. **Lymph nodes (N):** The report states ""pN0 (0/20)"", which means there is no regional lymph node metastasis. N0 indicates that cancer has not spread to nearby lymph nodes.

3. **Metastasis (M):** The report states ""pMx"", which means the presence of distant metastasis cannot be assessed. However, for staging purposes, if there is no evidence of metastasis, it is often considered as M0 unless specified otherwise.

Given these factors:
- T2
- N0
- M0 (assumed in the absence of evidence of metastasis)

According to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer:
- T2 N0 M0 corresponds to Stage IIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
12,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the lung cancer from the pathology report, we need to consider the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and any distant metastasis.

1. **Tumor Size (T):** The tumor is 2.7 cm in diameter. According to the AJCC 8th edition for lung cancer, a tumor size of 2.7 cm falls under T1c (tumor >2 cm but ≤3 cm).

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N):** The report indicates that there is metastatic adenocarcinoma in 1 out of 4 peribronchial lymph nodes, but no metastasis in the R4 and station 11 lymph nodes. This suggests N1 involvement (metastasis in ipsilateral peribronchial or hilar lymph nodes).

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so we assume M0 (no distant metastasis).

Based on the above information:
- T1c (tumor size >2 cm but ≤3 cm)
- N1 (metastasis in ipsilateral peribronchial or hilar lymph nodes)
- M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging for lung cancer, a T1c N1 M0 classification corresponds to Stage IIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
13,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging the cancer:

1. **Tumor Size and Invasion**: The tumor is 1.2 cm in size and invades into, but not through, the visceral pleura. This corresponds to a T2 classification in the TNM staging system.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: A total of 7 lymph nodes were examined, and none were involved with cancer (0/7). This corresponds to an N0 classification.

3. **Distant Metastasis**: The report indicates pMX, meaning that distant metastasis cannot be assessed from the information provided.

Based on the TNM classification provided (pT2, pN0, pMX), we can determine the stage of the cancer:

- **Stage I**: Typically involves T1 or T2 tumors with N0 and M0.
- **Stage II**: Typically involves T2 tumors with N1 or T3 tumors with N0 and M0.
- **Stage III**: Typically involves T3 or T4 tumors with N1 or N2 and M0.
- **Stage IV**: Involves any T, any N, and M1.

Given that the tumor is T2, N0, and there is no information on metastasis (MX), the most appropriate stage based on the available information is Stage I, as there is no lymph node involvement and no confirmed distant metastasis.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
14,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging:

1. **Primary Tumor (T):** The tumor is described as a 4 cm adenocarcinoma invading the visceral pleura, which corresponds to pT2. According to AJCC, T2 indicates a tumor size greater than 3 cm but 5 cm or less, or a tumor that involves the main bronchus, invades visceral pleura, or is associated with atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):** The report indicates metastatic adenocarcinoma in two of four lymph nodes and specifically mentions involvement of level 7 lymph nodes (mediastinal), which corresponds to pN2. N2 indicates metastasis to ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** The report states Mx, meaning distant metastasis cannot be assessed. However, for staging purposes, we consider the information provided, which does not confirm distant metastasis.

Based on the AJCC 8th edition staging system for lung cancer:
- **Stage III** is characterized by T1-T2, N2, M0 or T3, N1-N2, M0 or T4, N0-N2, M0.

Given the information:
- T2 (tumor size and pleural invasion)
- N2 (mediastinal lymph node involvement)
- Mx (distant metastasis not assessed, but no evidence of M1)

The cancer is classified as Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
15,"## Answer
The pathology report provides detailed information about the cancer diagnosis and staging. Let's break down the key elements:

1. **Tumor Size and Invasion**: The tumor is described as an invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, measuring 9.2 cm in greatest dimension, and invading into the chest wall. This indicates a T3 classification due to the size and chest wall invasion.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report states that there is no lymph node involvement (N0), as all examined lymph nodes (peribronchial, mediastinal, etc.) are negative for carcinoma.

3. **Metastasis**: The report does not provide information on distant metastasis (Mx), meaning it is not assessed.

According to the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, the combination of T3 (tumor >7 cm or invading the chest wall) and N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis) without distant metastasis (Mx) corresponds to Stage IIB.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
16,"## Answer
The pathology report provides several key pieces of information that are crucial for determining the AJCC stage of the cancer:

1. **Primary Tumor (pT):** The tumor is classified as pT2b, which indicates a tumor greater than 5 cm but 7 cm or less in greatest dimension.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN):** The report indicates pN2, which means there is metastasis in ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes. Specifically, 7 out of 19 lymph nodes are involved.

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM):** The report states ""Not applicable,"" which suggests there is no evidence of distant metastasis.

Based on the AJCC staging system for lung cancer:
- **Stage I** typically involves smaller tumors (T1 or T2a) with no lymph node involvement (N0).
- **Stage II** involves larger tumors (T2b or T3) with limited lymph node involvement (N1).
- **Stage III** involves any size tumor with more extensive lymph node involvement (N2 or N3), but no distant metastasis.
- **Stage IV** involves any tumor with distant metastasis (M1).

Given the information:
- The tumor size (pT2b) and the involvement of ipsilateral mediastinal lymph nodes (pN2) without distant metastasis (pM0) aligns with **Stage III** lung cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
17,"## Answer
The provided text does not contain specific information about the tumor size, lymph node involvement, or metastasis, which are critical components for determining the AJCC stage of cancer. The text appears to be instructions for completing a pathology report form rather than an actual pathology report with diagnostic details. Without specific details such as T (tumor size), N (lymph node involvement), and M (metastasis) classifications, it is not possible to determine the cancer stage.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Not Determinable""}"
18,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following information:

- The tumor is a well-differentiated papillary adenocarcinoma measuring 50 mm.
- The tumor extends to the visceral pleura but does not invade it.
- The bronchial resection level is tumor-free.
- Tumor classification is given as M-8140/3, G1, pT2, pN0, pMX.
- The report mentions ""stage I B"" and ""R 0"" (indicating no residual tumor).

Let's break down the TNM classification:

- **pT2**: This indicates a tumor size greater than 3 cm but 5 cm or less, or a tumor that involves the main bronchus or invades the visceral pleura, but not the entire lung.
- **pN0**: No regional lymph node metastasis.
- **pMX**: Distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

According to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for lung cancer:

- **Stage IB**: This corresponds to a tumor that is pT2a (tumor >3 cm but ≤5 cm or invades visceral pleura) and pN0 (no regional lymph node involvement), with no distant metastasis (MX or M0).

The pathology report explicitly states ""stage I B,"" which aligns with the TNM classification provided.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
19,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging:

1. **Tumor Size and Characteristics**: The tumor is 4.5 cm in size, located in the left upper lobe of the lung, and is an adenocarcinoma. It is poorly differentiated and unifocal. There is visceral pleural invasion and lymphovascular space invasion, but the tumor is confined to the lung.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: A total of six lymph nodes were examined, and one contained metastatic carcinoma. There is extracapsular extension with invasion of the adjacent artery wall.

3. **TNM Staging Provided**: The report specifies a pTNM stage of pT2aN1MX. This indicates:
   - **T2a**: Tumor size is more than 3 cm but 5 cm or less, or tumor involves the main bronchus or invades visceral pleura.
   - **N1**: Metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes and intrapulmonary nodes, including involvement by direct extension.
   - **MX**: Distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Based on the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for lung cancer:
- **Stage I**: Typically involves T1 or T2a with N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis).
- **Stage II**: Involves T1 or T2a with N1 (regional lymph node metastasis).
- **Stage III**: Involves more extensive T or N categories, such as T3 or N2.
- **Stage IV**: Involves any T, any N, and M1 (distant metastasis).

Given the information:
- The tumor is T2a.
- There is N1 lymph node involvement.
- Distant metastasis is not assessed (MX), but there is no indication of M1.

Therefore, the cancer is consistent with **Stage II** based on the T2aN1 classification.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
20,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to consider several factors from the pathology report, including tumor size, lymph node involvement, and metastasis. 

1. **Tumor Size**: The tumor size is given as 2.5 x 1.5 x 3 cm. According to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer, a tumor size of 3 cm or less typically corresponds to T1.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report states ""Lymph nodes: Not specified."" Without information on lymph node involvement, we cannot assume any nodal metastasis (N0).

3. **Distant Metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so we assume M0.

4. **Histologic Type and Grade**: The histologic type is bronchiolo-alveolar adenocarcinoma, and it is poorly differentiated. While histologic grade can influence prognosis, it does not directly affect the AJCC stage.

5. **Other Factors**: The report does not specify tumor extent, lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, or margins, which are important for a more precise staging but are not provided here.

Based on the information provided, the tumor is small (T1), with no specified lymph node involvement (N0), and no distant metastasis (M0). This would typically correspond to Stage I lung cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
21,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information:

1. **Primary Tumor (pT):** The tumor is classified as pT1b, which indicates a tumor size greater than 2 cm but 3 cm or less in greatest dimension.

2. **Lymph Nodes (pN):** The report indicates that there are five negative lymph nodes (0/5), meaning no regional lymph node metastasis is present. This corresponds to pN0.

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM):** There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, which implies pM0.

4. **Margins and Invasion:** The margins of resection are negative, and there is no direct extension of the tumor, venous invasion, arterial invasion, or lymphatic invasion identified.

Based on the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for lung cancer:

- **Stage I:** Tumors that are pT1a or pT1b with pN0 and pM0.
- **Stage II:** Typically involves larger tumors or those with limited lymph node involvement.
- **Stage III:** Involves more extensive lymph node involvement or larger tumors with local invasion.
- **Stage IV:** Involves distant metastasis.

Given the tumor size (pT1b), no lymph node involvement (pN0), and no distant metastasis (pM0), the cancer is classified as Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is -

22,"## Answer
The pathology report provides several key pieces of information that are crucial for determining the AJCC stage of the cancer:

1. **Primary Tumor (T):** The report mentions ""AJCC pT1N2MX,"" indicating that the primary tumor is classified as T1. This typically means the tumor is 3 cm or less in greatest dimension.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):** The report indicates ""N2,"" which means there is metastasis to ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes. This is a significant finding as it suggests more advanced regional spread.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** The report states ""MX,"" which means that the presence of distant metastasis cannot be assessed. However, there is no explicit mention of distant metastasis being confirmed.

4. **Histologic Grade and Other Findings:** The tumor is described as poorly differentiated, and there is mention of angiolymphatic invasion, which can indicate a more aggressive tumor. However, the margins are uninvolved, and there is no overt pleural infiltration.

Based on the AJCC staging system for lung cancer, a classification of T1N2MX typically corresponds to Stage IIIA. This is because the tumor is small (T1), but there is significant lymph node involvement (N2), and the distant metastasis status is unknown (MX).

Therefore, the answer is -

23,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging the cancer:

1. **Primary Tumor (pT):** The tumor is classified as pT1a, which indicates a tumor that is 2 cm or less in greatest dimension, surrounded by lung or visceral pleura, without bronchoscopic evidence of invasion more proximal than the lobar bronchus.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN):** The classification is pN0, indicating no regional lymph node metastasis.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, which implies M0.

Based on the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for lung cancer:

- **Stage I:** Typically includes T1a or T1b with N0 and M0.
- **Stage II:** Involves larger tumors or limited nodal involvement.
- **Stage III:** Involves more extensive nodal involvement or larger tumors.
- **Stage IV:** Indicates distant metastasis.

Given the tumor size (2.0 cm), lack of lymph node involvement (pN0), and no distant metastasis (M0), the cancer is classified as Stage I.

24,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to consider the TNM classification provided in the pathology report:

1. **Tumor Size and Extent (T):** The report states ""pT2b"". According to the AJCC staging system, T2b indicates a tumor size greater than 5 cm but less than or equal to 7 cm, without invasion of the visceral pleura or main bronchus.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):** The report states ""pN1 (6/28)"". N1 indicates that there is metastasis in ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes and intrapulmonary nodes, including involvement by direct extension.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** The report states ""pMx"", which means that distant metastasis cannot be assessed. However, for staging purposes, we assume no distant metastasis unless specified otherwise.

4. **Grade (G):** The report mentions ""G3"", which indicates a poorly differentiated tumor, but grading does not directly affect the AJCC stage.

Based on the TNM classification:
- T2b
- N1
- M0 (assumed, as Mx is not definitive for metastasis)

According to the AJCC 8th Edition for lung cancer:
- T2b, N1, M0 corresponds to Stage IIB.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
25,"## Answer
The pathology report provides detailed information about the cancer's characteristics and spread. Let's break down the key findings:

1. **Primary Tumor (T):**
   - The larger tumor in the left upper lobe is described as invasive adenocarcinoma with a size of 5.0 x 4.1 x 2.4 cm. It invades into but not through the pleura, which corresponds to T2.
   - The smaller tumor in the left lower lobe is 1.0 cm, which corresponds to T1.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):**
   - Multiple lymph nodes are positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma. Specifically, there is metastasis to lymph nodes in the left lung #6, #10, and AP window, as well as direct extension into intraparenchymal and peribronchial lymph nodes.
   - The involvement of multiple lymph node regions, including mediastinal and hilar nodes, corresponds to N2.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):**
   - The report indicates MX, meaning distant metastasis cannot be assessed. However, there is no mention of confirmed distant metastasis.

Based on the AJCC staging system for lung cancer:
- T2, N2, MX corresponds to Stage IIIA.
- T1, N2, MX also corresponds to Stage IIIA.

Therefore, the overall stage of the cancer, considering the most advanced findings, is Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
26,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging:

1. **Tumor Size and Characteristics**: The tumor is an invasive adenocarcinoma located in the left upper lobe of the lung, measuring 3.5 cm. It is unifocal, with no visceral pleura invasion, no lymphatic or large vessel invasion, and no atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis extending to the hilum.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report indicates that 3 out of 12 lymph nodes are involved with metastatic adenocarcinoma. Specifically, 2 of 2 peribronchial nodes are positive for metastatic tumor, and hilar node #2 is positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma. This corresponds to a pN1 classification, indicating metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial and/or hilar lymph nodes.

3. **Distant Metastasis**: The report states pMX, meaning that distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Based on the TNM classification provided in the report (pT2a, pN1, pMX), we can determine the stage:

- **T2a**: Tumor size is more than 3 cm but 5 cm or less.
- **N1**: Metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial and/or hilar lymph nodes.
- **M0/MX**: No distant metastasis or not assessed.

According to the AJCC 8th Edition staging system for lung cancer, a classification of T2a, N1, M0 corresponds to Stage IIB.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
27,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information:

1. **Tumor Size and Location**: The tumor is located in the left upper lobe and measures 3.5 x 2.8 x 2.5 cm.
2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: Metastatic adenocarcinoma is present in peribronchial lymph nodes and lymph nodes labeled 11L and #5, indicating N2 involvement.
3. **Margins and Invasion**: The tumor invades the visceral pleura, but the bronchial margin is negative for tumor.
4. **Pathologic Stage**: The report explicitly states the pathologic stage as pT2a N2 MX, which corresponds to Stage IIIA according to the AJCC staging system.

The AJCC staging system for lung cancer considers the size of the tumor (T), the involvement of lymph nodes (N), and the presence of metastasis (M). In this case, the tumor size and lymph node involvement (N2) are consistent with Stage IIIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
28,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information:

1. **Tumor Size and Invasion**: The tumor is a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma measuring 58 mm in maximal dimension. It invades through the visceral pleura and involves the chest wall fibrous connective tissue, but does not involve the rib bone or soft tissue resection margin.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: There is no evidence of lymph node metastases. The lymph nodes show reactive changes only.

3. **Distant Metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report.

4. **Staging Information**: The report provides a staging of T3N0MX. 

   - T3 indicates a tumor that is more than 5 cm but less than 7 cm, or a tumor that invades the chest wall, diaphragm, phrenic nerve, mediastinal pleura, or parietal pericardium.
   - N0 indicates no regional lymph node metastasis.
   - MX indicates that distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Based on the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for lung cancer:

- **Stage I**: T1 or T2, N0, M0
- **Stage II**: T1 or T2, N1, M0 or T3, N0, M0
- **Stage III**: T3, N1, M0 or T4, any N, M0 or any T, N2, M0
- **Stage IV**: Any T, any N, M1

Given the information, the tumor is classified as T3N0MX. Since there is no lymph node involvement (N0) and no evidence of distant metastasis (MX), the cancer fits the criteria for Stage II (T3, N0, M0).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
29,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following information:

- Tumor size: 6.00 cm
- Pathologic T stage: T2, NOS (Not Otherwise Specified)
- Pathologic N stage: N1
- Pathologic M stage: M0

According to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system:

- T2 indicates a tumor size greater than 3 cm but 7 cm or less, or a tumor that involves the main bronchus, visceral pleura, or causes atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis extending to the hilar region.
- N1 indicates metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes and intrapulmonary nodes, including involvement by direct extension.
- M0 indicates no distant metastasis.

Based on these criteria, the combination of T2, N1, and M0 corresponds to Stage II cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
30,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information:

1. **Tumor Size**: The tumor is 3.5 x 3 cm.
2. **Histologic Type**: Adenocarcinoma, poorly differentiated (G-3).
3. **Lymph Nodes**: 0 out of 7 hilar lymph nodes are positive for metastasis, indicating no lymph node involvement.
4. **Venous Invasion**: Absent.
5. **Margins**: Uninvolved, meaning the tumor has been completely excised with no cancer cells at the margins.
6. **Tumor Extent**: Not specified, but no evidence of spread beyond the lung tissue is mentioned.

Based on the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for lung cancer:

- **Stage I**: Tumor is ≤4 cm, no lymph node involvement, and no distant metastasis.
- **Stage II**: Tumor may be larger or involve nearby structures, or there may be limited lymph node involvement.
- **Stage III**: More extensive local spread or significant lymph node involvement.
- **Stage IV**: Distant metastasis.

Given the tumor size (3.5 cm), absence of lymph node involvement (0/7), and no mention of distant metastasis or invasion into other structures, the cancer fits the criteria for Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
31,"## Answer
The pathology report provides detailed information about the cancer diagnosis and staging. Here are the key points to consider:

1. **Tumor Characteristics**: The report describes adenocarcinoma in the right upper lobe of the lung with two separate tumor nodules. The largest tumor measures 3.7 cm in its greatest dimension.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report indicates that 11 lymph nodes were examined, and none were involved with malignancy (0/11).

3. **Metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis (pM not applicable).

4. **Pathologic Staging**: The report explicitly states the pathologic staging as Stage IIB, with a classification of pT3 pN0.

5. **AJCC Staging**: According to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for lung cancer:
   - **T3** indicates a tumor greater than 5 cm but less than or equal to 7 cm, or a tumor that directly invades any of the following: parietal pleura, chest wall, phrenic nerve, or parietal pericardium, or separate tumor nodules in the same lobe.
   - **N0** indicates no regional lymph node metastasis.
   - **M0** (implied by ""pM not applicable"") indicates no distant metastasis.

Given these details, the pathologic stage of the cancer is indeed Stage IIB, as stated in the report.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
32,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging:

1. **Primary Tumor (T):** The tumor is described as T2, which indicates a tumor greater than 3 cm in greatest dimension. This is consistent with a T2 classification in lung cancer staging.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):** The report indicates N1, which means there are metastases in ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes. This suggests that the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes on the same side as the primary tumor.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** The report states MX, which means distant metastasis cannot be assessed. However, there is no indication of distant metastasis being present.

Based on the AJCC staging system for lung cancer:
- **Stage I** typically involves T1 or T2 tumors with no lymph node involvement (N0) and no distant metastasis (M0).
- **Stage II** involves T1 or T2 tumors with N1 lymph node involvement and no distant metastasis (M0).
- **Stage III** involves more extensive lymph node involvement (N2 or N3) or larger tumors (T3 or T4).
- **Stage IV** involves distant metastasis (M1).

Given the T2 classification and N1 lymph node involvement, with no evidence of distant metastasis, the cancer is consistent with **Stage II**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
33,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information:

1. **Primary Tumor (pT):** The tumor is an adenocarcinoma measuring 2.5 cm in greatest dimension. There is a suggestion of visceral pleural invasion, but it is not definitively confirmed. The margins of resection are uninvolved, and there is no direct extension of the tumor, nor venous, arterial, or lymphatic invasion identified.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN):** The report indicates that there is no evidence of metastasis in the lymph nodes examined. Specifically, level 12 lymph nodes show no evidence of metastasis in four nodes, level 7 lymph nodes show no evidence of metastasis in seven nodes, and level 11 lymph nodes show no evidence of metastasis in three nodes. Level 9 lymph nodes were not identified.

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM):** The report states that distant metastasis cannot be evaluated by this specimen (pMX).

Based on the AJCC staging system for lung cancer:
- **T2a:** Tumor size is greater than 2 cm but less than or equal to 3 cm.
- **N0:** No regional lymph node metastasis.
- **M0:** No distant metastasis (though pMX is noted, we assume no clinical evidence of metastasis).

Given these findings, the cancer would be classified as T2aN0M0, which corresponds to Stage IB according to the AJCC 8th edition for lung cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
34,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging the cancer:

1. **Primary Tumor (pT):** The tumor measures 3.5 cm in maximum dimension and invades into the pleura, classified as pT2. According to the AJCC staging system, a pT2 tumor is one that is more than 3 cm but 5 cm or less, or involves the main bronchus, invades visceral pleura, or is associated with atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN):** The report states pNX, meaning the regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed. This implies that there is no information on lymph node involvement.

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM):** The report states pMX, meaning distant metastasis cannot be assessed. This implies that there is no information on distant metastasis.

Given the information:
- The tumor is classified as pT2.
- There is no information on lymph node involvement (pNX) or distant metastasis (pMX).

In the absence of lymph node involvement and distant metastasis information, we typically consider the tumor size and local invasion for staging. A pT2 tumor without confirmed lymph node involvement or distant metastasis is generally considered Stage II, as Stage I would typically involve smaller tumors (pT1) without pleural invasion.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
35,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information:

1. **Tumor Size and Characteristics**: The tumor is a 2.8 cm invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with angiolymphatic and visceral pleural invasion. This corresponds to a T2 classification because the tumor is greater than 3 cm but less than or equal to 5 cm, or it involves the visceral pleura.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: All sampled lymph nodes are benign, indicating no regional lymph node metastasis. This corresponds to an N0 classification.

3. **Distant Metastasis**: The report states MX, which means distant metastasis cannot be assessed. However, there is no evidence provided in the report of distant metastasis.

Based on the AJCC staging system, a T2N0MX classification typically corresponds to Stage II. However, since MX indicates that distant metastasis cannot be assessed, we must rely on the information provided, which suggests no evidence of metastasis.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
36,"## Answer
The pathology report provides several key pieces of information that are relevant for staging the cancer according to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) guidelines:

1. **Tumor Size and Location**: The tumor is located in the middle lobe of the right lung and measures 5.5 x 5.0 cm. This size typically corresponds to a T2 classification, as it is greater than 3 cm but less than 7 cm.

2. **Tumor Focality and Extension**: The tumor is unifocal and extends into the fissure, but there is no visceral pleural invasion, which is important for determining the T stage.

3. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report mentions several lymph nodes (inferior pulmonary ligament, periesophageal, subcarinal, paratracheal, proximal) but states that twelve lymph nodes are negative for carcinoma. This suggests no regional lymph node involvement, which corresponds to N0.

4. **Distant Metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, which would correspond to M0.

5. **Histologic Grade**: The tumor is poorly differentiated (G3), which can influence prognosis but does not directly affect the AJCC stage.

Based on the information provided:
- Tumor size and extension suggest T2.
- No lymph node involvement suggests N0.
- No distant metastasis suggests M0.

Combining these, the pathologic stage would be T2N0M0, which corresponds to Stage II according to the AJCC staging system for non-small cell lung cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
37,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to consider the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and any distant metastasis.

1. **Tumor Size (T):** The pathology report indicates a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with clear cell changes measuring 7 cm in the right lung. According to AJCC staging, a tumor greater than 5 cm but less than or equal to 7 cm is classified as T2b.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N):** The report states that there is no tumor seen in any of the lymph nodes examined, including mediastinal, right level 4, level 7, and peribronchial lymph nodes. This indicates N0, meaning no regional lymph node metastasis.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so we assume M0, indicating no distant metastasis.

Based on the above information:
- T2b (tumor size > 5 cm but ≤ 7 cm)
- N0 (no regional lymph node involvement)
- M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system for lung cancer, a T2b N0 M0 classification corresponds to Stage IIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
38,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging:

1. **Primary Tumor (T):** The tumor is classified as pT2a, which indicates a tumor more than 3 cm but 5 cm or less in greatest dimension.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):** The report indicates pN1, which means there is metastasis in ipsilateral peribronchial lymph nodes. Specifically, metastatic carcinoma is found in 3 of 18 lymph nodes.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, suggesting M0.

According to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for lung cancer:

- **Stage I** typically involves T1 or T2a tumors with N0 (no regional lymph node involvement).
- **Stage II** can involve T2a tumors with N1 (metastasis in ipsilateral peribronchial lymph nodes).
- **Stage III** involves more extensive lymph node involvement (N2 or N3) or larger tumors (T3 or T4).
- **Stage IV** involves distant metastasis (M1).

Given the information:
- The tumor is T2a.
- There is N1 lymph node involvement.
- There is no distant metastasis (M0).

This corresponds to **Stage II** lung cancer according to the AJCC staging system.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
