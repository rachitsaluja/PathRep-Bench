The uterus shows foci of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in the endometrium, but the lower uterine segment and cervix are free of carcinoma, and leiomyomas are noted in the myometrium. The findings suggest a complex scenario of synchronous primary peritoneal and endometrial carcinomas or potential metastasis from the peritoneum, given the extensive tumor spread and the patient's history of endometrial adenocarcinoma."
23,"The pathology report indicates a diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme, grade IV, in a biopsy, tumor resection, and tumor aspiration from the left anterior temporal region of the brain.
