Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor (pT) is classified as pT3, which means the tumor is larger than 5 cm or has invaded the mediastinum or involves the visceral pleura.
2. The regional lymph nodes (pN) are classified as pN1, which means there is metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes.
3. The metastasis (pM) is classified as pMX, which means distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Based on the pT3 and pN1 classifications, the AJCC stage is Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
1,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions a 1.1 cm moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in the lung, which is T1a according to the AJCC 8th edition staging system (tumor size ≤ 1 cm).

2. The tumor has invaded the pleura, which is classified as PL1 (invasion of visceral pleura). This does not affect the T stage.

3. There is no lymphovascular invasion mentioned in the report.

4. The report mentions a benign intrapulmonary lymph node, negative for carcinoma, which means there is no N1 disease.

5. The margin of resection is negative for carcinoma, which indicates that the tumor has been completely resected.

6. The report also mentions a segment of the 6th rib resection, which is negative for carcinoma. This suggests that the tumor has invaded the rib, which is classified as M1b (distant metastasis).

Considering the above points, the TNM staging would be T1a, N0, M1b.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T1a, N0, M1b tumor corresponds to Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IV""}"
2,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor (T) is described as a 27 mm poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma in the right upper lobe, with focal blood vessel and perineural invasion, but no lymphatic permeation. This corresponds to a T1 tumor, as it is ≤ 3 cm in size.

2. The lymph nodes (N) are involved, with a deposit of poorly differentiated carcinoma present within the hilar lymph node cortex. This indicates N1 disease, as the tumor has metastasized to the hilar lymph nodes.

3. There is no mention of distant metastases (M) in the report, so we can assume M0.

Based on the TNM classification, the patient has a T1N1M0 tumor.

According to the AJCC staging system, a T1N1M0 tumor corresponds to Stage II.

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the left lung, and it is a Grade II-III squamous carcinoma that involves the pleura and focally extends to the inked pleural margin.
2. The tumor size is not explicitly mentioned, but based on the gross description, it appears to be at least 4.5 cm in greatest dimension.
3. The vascular and bronchial margins of resection are negative, indicating that the tumor has not invaded these areas.
4. There are multiple lymph nodes examined, including level 9, 10, 5, and 7 lymph nodes, and all of them are negative for tumor.
5. Since the tumor involves the pleura, it is classified as T3 (tumor invades the visceral pleura).
6. The absence of tumor in the lymph nodes indicates that the N stage is N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis).
7. There is no evidence of distant metastasis (M0) in the report.

Based on the TNM staging system, the patient's cancer can be classified as T3N0M0.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T3N0M0 tumor corresponds to Stage II.

4,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (T)**: The tumor is described as an exophytic invasive moderately to poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, measuring 3.7 x 2.8 x 2.8 cm. According to the AJCC 8th edition, this corresponds to a T2 tumor, as it is larger than 3 cm but not larger than 5 cm.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N)**: The report indicates that one out of ten peribronchial lymph nodes is positive for metastasis (N1). There is no involvement of contralateral mediastinal/hilar, scalene, or supraclavicular lymph nodes (N3).

3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so we can assume M0.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* T2 (primary tumor size)
* N1 (ipsilateral hilar and/or peribronchial lymph node involvement)
* M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, this corresponds to **Stage IIA**.

However, since the options provided do not include Stage IIA, we need to consider the closest match. Stage II is a possible match, as it also corresponds to a T2 tumor with N1 lymph node involvement. Therefore, the answer is:

6,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor (pT) is classified as pT2a, which means the tumor is > 3 cm and < 5 cm in greatest dimension, surrounded by lung or visceral pleura, without bronchoscopic evidence of invasion in the main bronchus.
2. The regional lymph nodes (pN) are classified as pNO, which means there is no regional lymph node metastasis.
3. There is no mention of distant metastasis (pM) in the report.

Based on the TNM classification, the patient's cancer can be staged as follows:

* Tumor (T): T2a (primary tumor is > 3 cm and < 5 cm in greatest dimension)
* Node (N): N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis)
* Metastasis (M): M0 (no distant metastasis)

8,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions a primary tumor in the right lower lobe of the lung, measuring 5 x 4.5 x 2.6 cm, which is a significant size. However, it does not extend through the pleura, which suggests that the tumor is still localized within the lung.

2. The bronchial margin is negative for tumor, indicating that the tumor has not invaded the bronchus.

3. Multiple intrapulmonary peribronchial lymph nodes are negative for tumor, which suggests that the tumor has not spread to the regional lymph nodes within the lung.

4. The report also mentions that multiple superior and inferior mediastinal lymph nodes, as well as N1 lymph nodes, are negative for tumor. This indicates that the tumor has not spread to the mediastinal lymph nodes or the N1 lymph nodes.

Based on these findings, we can conclude that the tumor is localized within the lung, has not invaded the bronchus, and has not spread to the regional lymph nodes. This corresponds to the T2 category (tumor > 4 cm in greatest dimension) and N0 category (no regional lymph node metastasis).

According to the AJCC staging system, a T2N0 tumor corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
9,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the left upper lobe of the lung, and its greatest diameter is 3.2 cm, which corresponds to a T2 tumor (T1: ≤ 3 cm, T2: > 3 cm but ≤ 5 cm, T3: > 5 cm but ≤ 7 cm, T4: > 7 cm).
2. The tumor involves the visceral pleura, but there is no vascular invasion, perineural invasion, or bronchial margin involvement.
3. The lymph node status is as follows: peribronchial lymph nodes are 0/8, indicating no metastasis to these nodes.
4. However, the report does not mention any metastasis to other lymph nodes, such as mediastinal lymph nodes, which is crucial in determining the N stage.
5. Since there is no mention of distant metastasis, the M stage is M0.

Based on the above information, we can determine the TNM stage as follows:

* T stage: T2 (tumor size > 3 cm but ≤ 5 cm)
* N stage: N2 (metastasis to mediastinal lymph nodes, although not explicitly stated, it can be inferred from the multiple lymph node biopsies with benign results)
* M stage: M0 (no distant metastasis)

10,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

First, we need to identify the primary tumor (pT) stage, which is pT1b. This indicates that the tumor is 2 cm or less in size and has not invaded the visceral pleura.

Next, we need to determine the regional lymph node (pN) stage, which is pNO. This means that there is no evidence of tumor in the regional lymph nodes.

Since there is no evidence of distant metastasis (pM), we can focus on the pT and pN stages to determine the overall AJCC stage.

Based on the pT1b and pNO stages, we can conclude that the cancer is localized to the primary site and has not spread to the regional lymph nodes.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"

{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
14,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to analyze the pathology report and identify the key components that contribute to the staging.

First, we look at the Pathological T (pT) stage, which is T2a. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual, a T2a tumor is defined as a tumor that is >2 cm but ≤3 cm in greatest dimension.

Next, we examine the Pathological N (pN) stage, which is N1. This indicates that there is metastasis to 1-3 lymph nodes.

The Clinical M (cM) stage is M0, indicating that there is no distant metastasis.

Now, we can use the TNM staging system to determine the overall stage. Based on the pT2a and pN1 stages, the patient has a Stage III cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
15,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Tumor size**: The tumor size is 3 X 3 X 3.5 cm, which is a significant factor in determining the T stage. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a tumor of this size would correspond to a T2 stage (tumors > 3 cm but ≤ 5 cm in greatest dimension).

2. **Lymph nodes**: The report does not specify the involvement of lymph nodes, which means we cannot determine the N stage from this information.

3. **Metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, which suggests that the M stage is likely M0 (no distant metastasis).

4. **Tumor extent**: The report does not specify the tumor extent, which means we cannot determine if the tumor has invaded surrounding structures or not.

Given the available information, we can conclude that the tumor is at least T2 (due to its size), but we cannot determine the N stage or M stage with certainty. However, since there is no mention of distant metastasis, it is likely that the M stage is M0.

Based on the available information, the most likely stage would be **Stage II**, as the tumor is at least T2, and there is no evidence of distant metastasis.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (T)**: The tumor size is 4.2 x 4.0 x 2.3 cm, which corresponds to T2a (tumor > 3 cm but ≤ 5 cm in greatest dimension).
2. **Visceral Pleural Invasion (VPI)**: The report mentions ""Tumor invades the pleura"" under Surgical Margin Status, which indicates VPI is present.
3. **Lymph Node Status (N)**: Only 1 peribronchial node was received, and it did not contain metastatic carcinoma, so N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis).
4. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so M0 (no distant metastasis).

Based on the above information, the pTNM stage is pT2a N0 M0, which corresponds to **Stage II** according to the AJCC 8th edition staging system.

Therefore, the answer is -

2. The tumor has extensive vascular invasion and focal perineural invasion, but no lymphatic invasion.
3. The soft tissue resection margin is clear of malignancy, and the upper lobe resection margin is also clear of malignancy.
4. The lymph node sampling reveals metastatic carcinoma in one of the lymph nodes (No. 11 lymph node), which corresponds to N1.

Based on the TNM classification, the patient has a T3 primary tumor with N1 lymph node involvement. According to the AJCC staging system, this corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
21,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the primary tumor (T), lymph nodes (N), and distant metastasis (M).

From the pathology report, we can gather the following information:

* Primary tumor (T): The tumor is 6.4 cm in size, and it invades the adjacent structure, which is the chest wall and rib (T3).
* Lymph nodes (N): All sampled lymph nodes (8) are benign, which means there is no lymph node involvement (N0).
* Distant metastasis (M): There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so we can assume M0.

Based on the TNM classification, the patient has a pT3N0M0 tumor.

According to the AJCC staging system, a pT3N0M0 tumor corresponds to Stage IIB.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IIB}"
22,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to analyze the pathology report and identify the key features that determine the stage.

From the report, we can see that the tumor is a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with a diameter of 5.0 cm, which corresponds to a T2 tumor size (T2: tumor >3 cm but ≤5 cm).

The report also mentions that there is no evidence of visceral pleural or angiolymphatic invasion, which suggests that the tumor has not invaded the visceral pleura or lymphatic vessels.

Regarding lymph node involvement, the report states that one of fifteen N1 lymph nodes is positive for metastases, which corresponds to an N1 nodal status (N1: metastasis in ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes).

There is no evidence of metastases in the N2 lymph nodes, and no distant metastases are mentioned in the report, which suggests that the M status is MX (MX: distant metastasis cannot be assessed).

Based on the TNM classification, the pathologic stage is T2N1MX.

According to the AJCC staging system, a T2N1MX corresponds to Stage IIA.

Therefore, the answer is -

23,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the left lung, and it measures 11.0 cm in its greatest dimension. This corresponds to a pT2 tumor, as it is larger than 5 cm but not more than 7 cm.

2. The visceral pleural, bronchial, and vascular margins are negative for tumor, indicating that the tumor has not invaded these structures.

3. The lymph node status is as follows: 
   - Level 9 lymph nodes: 0/3 positive
   - Level 5 lymph nodes: 0/5 positive
   - Level 10 lymph nodes: 1/1 positive
   - Level 6 lymph nodes: 0/1 positive
   - Level 7 lymph nodes: 0/5 positive
   - Peribronchial lymph nodes: 1/12 positive

This indicates that there is metastasis to the lymph nodes, specifically to the Level 10 lymph node and one of the peribronchial lymph nodes. This corresponds to an N1 nodal status, as the metastasis is limited to the ipsilateral peribronchial and/or hilar lymph nodes.

4. There is no evidence of distant metastasis (M0) in the report.

Based on the pT2 primary tumor and N1 nodal status, the AJCC stage of the cancer is Stage IIA.

24,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the Cancer:

1. **Tumor size**: The tumor size is 3 x 2 x 2 cm, which is a relatively small size. This suggests that the primary tumor (T) is likely to be T1 or T2, as T3 tumors are typically larger than 5 cm.

2. **Lymph nodes**: The report states that 3 out of 6 lymph nodes are positive for metastasis, which indicates that the cancer has spread to the regional lymph nodes. This corresponds to N2, as N2 is defined as metastasis to ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes.

3. **Distant metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, which suggests that M0 (no distant metastasis) is the correct classification.

4. **AJCC Stage**: Based on the T, N, and M classifications, we can determine the AJCC Stage. With a T1 or T2 primary tumor, N2 regional lymph node involvement, and no distant metastasis (M0), the AJCC Stage is likely to be Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is -

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the cancer:

1. **Tumor size**: The tumor size is 8x8x8cm, which is a significant size, but it doesn't directly determine the stage.

2. **Tumor extent**: The tumor has invaded the visceral pleura, which indicates a T2 or higher classification (T2: Tumor invades visceral pleura).

3. **Lymph nodes**: 8 out of 10 lymph nodes are positive for metastasis, which is a significant number. This indicates an N2 classification (N2: Metastasis to ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph node(s)).

4. **Distant metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report.

Considering the above factors, we can determine the TNM classification as follows:

* T: T2 (tumor invades visceral pleura)
* N: N2 (metastasis to ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph node(s))
* M: M0 (no distant metastasis)

27,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor is a squamous cell carcinoma, moderately differentiated, with a maximal tumor size of 7.7 cm. This corresponds to a T2 tumor, as it is greater than 3 cm in greatest dimension.
2. The visceral pleura is invaded, which is also consistent with a T2 tumor.
3. There is no regional lymph node metastasis, as all peribronchial lymph nodes (6 lobar and 1 segmental) are negative for malignancy. This corresponds to an N0 node status.
4. There is no mention of distant metastasis, so the M status is M0.

Based on the TNM staging system, a T2N0M0 tumor corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is -

28,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the left upper lobe of the lung, measuring 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm, and is 1.8 cm away from the bronchial margin, which is negative for tumor. This suggests that the tumor is confined to the lung and has not invaded the bronchial margin.

2. The report mentions that multiple (10) intrapulmonary peribronchial lymph nodes are positive for tumor, which indicates lymph node involvement.

3. The visceral pleura is also involved, which suggests that the tumor has invaded the pleura.

4. The report also mentions that multiple lymph nodes in the superior mediastinal, aortic, inferior mediastinal, and left lower lobe bronchus regions are negative for tumor.

Considering the above points, we can determine the T, N, and M stages as follows:

* T stage: The tumor is 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm in size and has invaded the visceral pleura, which corresponds to a T2b stage (tumor > 2 cm in greatest dimension and invades the visceral pleura).
* N stage: The presence of tumor in multiple intrapulmonary peribronchial lymph nodes corresponds to an N1 stage (metastasis to intrapulmonary nodes).
* M stage: There is no evidence of distant metastasis, so the M stage is M0.

Based on the T, N, and M stages, we can determine the overall AJCC stage. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2bN1M0 stage corresponds to Stage IIA.

However, since the options provided do not include Stage IIA, we need to consider the closest match. Given that the tumor has invaded the visceral pleura and has lymph node involvement, the closest match would be Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
29,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (T)**: The tumor size is 4.5 cm, and it invades the visceral pleura but not the pericardium. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, this corresponds to a T2 tumor.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N)**: The pathology report states that 7 lymph nodes were examined, and none of them were involved by the tumor (pNO). This indicates that the regional lymph nodes are not affected by the cancer.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the pathology report, so we can assume that the cancer has not spread to distant organs or tissues (pMX).

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage of the cancer. Since the tumor is T2, N0, and MX, it corresponds to **Stage II** according to the AJCC 8th edition staging system.

According to the new guidelines, two nodules of similar histology in the same lobe would be classified as pT3.

2. Regional lymph nodes (pN): The report states that there is metastatic carcinoma in one of three hilar lymph nodes, which corresponds to pN1.

3. Distant metastasis (pM): The report indicates that there is no evidence of distant metastasis, so pMX.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

1. The report mentions the tumor size as 3 X 2.5 X 2 cm, which is a key factor in determining the T stage (primary tumor size).
2. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a tumor size of 3 cm or less corresponds to a T1 stage.
3. There is no mention of lymph node involvement or distant metastases in the report, which suggests that the N stage (lymph node involvement) and M stage (distant metastases) are likely N0 and M0, respectively.
4. Since the report does not provide information on lymph node involvement or distant metastases, we cannot rule out the possibility of N1, N2, or M1 stages. However, based on the available information, it is reasonable to assume that the N and M stages are likely to be N0 and M0, respectively.
5. Combining the T1 stage with the assumed N0 and M0 stages, we can determine the overall stage of the cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
32,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (T)**: The tumor size is 4.0 cm, which corresponds to pT2 (tumor with any of the following features of size or extent: greater than 3 cm in greatest dimension).
2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N)**: One lobar lymph node out of nine lymph nodes is positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma, which corresponds to pN1 (metastasis in ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes, including intrapulmonary nodes involved by direct extension of the primary tumor).
3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so pMX (cannot be assessed) is assigned.

Based on the pTNM staging, the patient has a pT2N1 tumor, which corresponds to **Stage II** according to the AJCC 8th edition staging system.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
33,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (pT)**: The report states that the tumor measures 4.9 cm in maximum dimension, which corresponds to pT2a (Tumor > 3 cm, and < 5 cm in greatest dimension surrounded by lung or visceral pleura, without bronchoscopic evidence of invasion in the main bronchus).

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN)**: The report indicates that multiple lymph nodes were excised and examined, but none of them showed malignancy (0/6). This corresponds to pN0 (No regional lymph node metastasis).

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM)**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so pM is not applicable.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

**AJCC Stage**: The patient has a pT2a primary tumor and pN0 regional lymph nodes, which corresponds to **Stage II**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
34,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary tumor (pT)**: The tumor measures 5.5 cm in dimension and extends through the pleura but is not identified at the outer surface of the specimen. This corresponds to a T2b tumor (tumor > 5 cm in greatest dimension).
2. **Margins of resection**: The margins are negative for tumor.
3. **Direct extension of tumor**: The tumor extends into the pleura, which shows a desmoplastic response to tumor.
4. **Vessel invasion**: Not identified.
5. **Regional lymph nodes (pN)**: pNO, meaning no regional lymph node metastases are identified.
6. **Distant metastasis (pM)**: pMx, meaning distant metastases cannot be assessed.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* Tumor (T): T2b (tumor > 5 cm in greatest dimension)
* Node (N): N0 (no regional lymph node metastases)
* Metastasis (M): Mx (distant metastases cannot be assessed)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2bN0Mx tumor corresponds to **Stage II**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
35,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to analyze the pathology report and identify the key features that affect staging.

First, we look at the tumor size, which is 4.9 x 4.7 x 4.5 cm, making it a T3 tumor (tumor > 5 cm in greatest dimension).

Next, we examine the lymph node status. The report indicates that the lobar lymph nodes are negative for carcinoma, which means there is no nodal involvement (N0).

The pleural surface status shows that the carcinoma invades through the visceral and parietal pleura into the chest wall skeletal muscle and into rib bone, which is classified as PL3 (pleural invasion).

Considering these factors, we can determine the pathologic stage (TNM classification) as pT3 pNO PL3.

According to the AJCC staging system, a T3 tumor with no nodal involvement (N0) and pleural invasion (PL3) corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
36,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer:

1. The primary tumor (T) is described as a 4.5 x 4 x 3 cm intrabronchial and parenchymal hilar mass, which is a significant size. However, there is no mention of invasion into the pleura, which would be a T3 or T4 descriptor. Therefore, the primary tumor is likely a T2.

2. The report mentions that the tumor extends to within a few millimeters of the bronchial margin, which is involved by extensive in situ carcinoma. This does not affect the T stage.

3. The lymph node involvement is extensive, with metastases in multiple intrapulmonary peribronchial lymph nodes (6 of 14), aortopulmonary lymph nodes (2 of 2), and anterior mediastinal lymph nodes (1 of 2). This indicates N2 disease, as there are metastases in mediastinal lymph nodes.

4. There is no mention of distant metastases (M) in the report.

Based on the above analysis, the TNM stage is T2N2M0, which corresponds to Stage III according to the AJCC staging system.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
37,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is a poorly differentiated large cell carcinoma with squamoid features, 3.5 cm in greatest dimension, predominantly endobronchial, but with pulmonary parenchymal invasion.
2. The tumor is confined to the right lower lobe, and the closest inked pleural margin is negative for malignancy.
3. There is no lymphovascular invasion, and the bronchus and blood vessels at the surgical margin are negative for malignancy.
4. No hilar lymph nodes are identified with cancer.
5. Multiple lymph nodes from different stations (subcarinal, right hilum, right lower peritracheal area) are examined, and all are benign anthracotic lymph nodes.

Based on the above information, we can determine the T, N, and M stages as follows:

* T stage: T2 (tumor > 3 cm in greatest dimension)
* N stage: N0 (no regional lymph node metastases)
* M stage: M0 (no distant metastases)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2N0M0 corresponds to Stage I.

38,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the right lower lobe lung, measuring 2.9 x 2.5 x 1.8 cm.
2. The tumor extends subpleurally but not to the pleural surface, which suggests a T2a tumor (since it's larger than 2 cm but not more than 3 cm in greatest dimension, and it doesn't invade the visceral pleura).
3. There is no vascular invasion or perineural invasion.
4. The bronchial margin is free of tumor.
5. The lymph node status is as follows: all lymph nodes examined (Level VII mediastinal, Level VII mediastinal #2, Right mediastinal lymph node level XI) are benign, with no metastatic nodes identified. This suggests an N0 lymph node status.
6. There is no evidence of distant metastasis (M0) in the report.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* T2a (primary tumor size and extension)
* N0 (no lymph node metastasis)
* M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2a, N0, M0 tumor corresponds to Stage I.

40,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions that the tumor is staged as pT3 due to the presence of separate tumor nodules in the same lobe, away from the main central tumor.
2. The tumor size is reported as 5.5 cm x 4.0 cm x 3.5 cm, which is greater than 7 cm in greatest dimension, which would also qualify as pT3.
3. There is no evidence of tumor extension to the chest wall, diaphragm, phrenic nerve, mediastinal pleura, or parietal pericardium, which would have upgraded the tumor stage to pT4.
4. The bronchial and vascular margins of resection are negative for carcinoma, indicating that the tumor has not invaded these margins.
5. There is no evidence of lymphovascular invasion or extranodal extension.
6. The report mentions that 8 lymph nodes were examined, and none of them showed metastatic carcinoma, indicating pN0.
7. There is no evidence of distant metastasis (pM0).

Based on the above findings, the TNM staging is pT3N0M0.

According to the AJCC staging system, a pT3N0M0 corresponds to Stage II.

42,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can see that the tumor is located in the left upper lobe of the lung and has invaded the chest wall and rib (part of ribs 2 and 3). The tumor size is 4.5 cm, and it is approximately 0.5 cm from the inked margin.

There is no lymph node involvement, as all the lymph nodes excised (7, 8, 9, 11-L, 5, and 6) are negative for malignancy.

The tumor has also invaded the soft tissue, including the serratus muscle, intercostal muscle, and middle scalene muscle.

There is no evidence of distant metastasis, as the pleura is uninvolved, and no other organs are affected.

Based on the TNM classification, the tumor is classified as T3 (invasion of the chest wall and rib), N0 (no lymph node involvement), and Mx (no distant metastasis).

According to the AJCC staging system, a T3N0Mx tumor corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"

{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
46,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The tumor size is 5.0 cm, which corresponds to T2 (tumor > 3 cm but ≤ 5 cm).
* The lymph node status is as follows: Peribronchial - 6/9; Parenchymal - 1/1, which indicates that there are metastases in the regional lymph nodes. This corresponds to N2 (metastases in ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes).
* There is no evidence of distant metastasis (M0).

49,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions that the carcinoma involves the pleural surface, which indicates that the tumor has invaded the visceral pleura (T2).
2. All surgical margins of resection are negative for tumor, which suggests that the tumor has not invaded the surrounding tissues (R0 resection).
3. The report mentions that one hilar lymph node and associated fibroadipose tissue are negative for tumor, which indicates that there is no lymph node involvement (N0).
4. Additionally, two other lymph nodes (Station 5 and L11) are also negative for tumor, further supporting the absence of lymph node involvement.

Based on the above findings, we can determine the T, N, and M stages as follows:

* T stage: T2 (tumor invades the visceral pleura)
* N stage: N0 (no lymph node involvement)
* M stage: M0 (no distant metastases mentioned in the report)

According to the AJCC staging system, a T2N0M0 corresponds to Stage II.

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions a ""poorly-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma"" with a maximal dimension of 37mm, which corresponds to a T2 tumor (Tumor size > 3 cm but ≤ 5 cm).
2. There is no evidence of pleural invasion, blood vessel invasion, lymphatic permeation, or perineural permeation, which suggests that the tumor has not invaded nearby structures.
3. The bronchial resection margin is clear of the tumor, indicating that the tumor has not spread to the bronchial margin.
4. The peribronchial lymph nodes show sinus histiocytosis and contain carbon pigment, but there is no evidence of metastases, which means that the lymph nodes are not involved (N0).
5. There is no mention of distant metastases (Mx), which means that the cancer has not spread to other parts of the body.

Based on these findings, the pathological stage is T2N0Mx, which corresponds to Stage II (T2N0M0) according to the AJCC staging system.

51,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor size is 4 X 3 X 3.5 cm, which is larger than 3 cm but not more than 5 cm. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, this corresponds to a T2 tumor.

2. There is no information about tumor extent, lymph nodes, lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, or margins, which are important factors in determining the N and M components of the TNM staging system. However, the absence of information does not necessarily imply the absence of these features.

3. Since there is no information about lymph node involvement or distant metastases, we cannot determine the N and M components. However, we can infer that the M component is likely M0 (no distant metastases) since there is no mention of metastases in the report.

4. Given the T2 tumor and unknown N and M components, we can narrow down the possible stages to Stage I, II, or III.

5. Since there is no information to suggest lymph node involvement or distant metastases, the most likely stage is Stage I, which corresponds to a T1 or T2 tumor with N0 and M0 components.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor (T) is a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, 28 mm in maximal dimension, located in the right upper lobe. The tumor appears to directly invade a peribronchial lymph node. According to the AJCC 8th edition, this corresponds to a T2 tumor (tumor > 20 mm but ≤ 30 mm in greatest dimension).

2. The lymph nodes (N) are involved, with squamous cell carcinoma present in one of the lymph nodes (specimen 8). This corresponds to an N1 lymph node status (metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial and/or hilar lymph nodes).

3. There is no evidence of distant metastasis (M) in the report.

4. The TNM classification is therefore T2N1M0, which corresponds to Stage IIA according to the AJCC 8th edition.

However, the report mentions ""T2N1MX"" in the summary, which is inconsistent with the actual findings. The correct TNM classification is T2N1M0.

55,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

First, we need to identify the T stage, N stage, and M stage from the report.

The T stage is pT2a, which indicates that the tumor is 4.5 cm in size, but has not invaded the visceral pleura or the main bronchus.

The N stage is pNO, which means that there is no evidence of lymph node metastasis.

The M stage is not applicable, which implies that there is no distant metastasis.

Now, let's refer to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer. Based on the T and N stages, we can determine the overall stage.

A T2a tumor with no lymph node involvement (N0) corresponds to Stage I.

2. The tumor size is 3.0 X 3.0 X 3.0 cm, and it extends to the peripheral aspect of the lung.
3. There is no visceral pleural invasion, but findings are suspicious for lymphovascular invasion.
4. The tumor appears confined to the lung, and the distance from the bronchial margin is 2.0 cm, and from the pleural surface is less than 0.1 cm.
5. The lymph node status shows that none of the 2 lymph nodes received contain metastatic carcinoma (0/2).
6. However, the report mentions a revision, stating that upon re-review, a satellite tumor is discovered, which classifies the neoplasm as a stage T3.

Based on the revised classification, the tumor is pT3NO, which corresponds to Stage IIb according to the AJCC 8th edition staging system.

Therefore, the answer is -
