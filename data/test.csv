MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received in seven parts, each labeled with the. patient's name. 1. Part one is received fresh, labeled 'lingular nodule'. It. consists of a lingular segment of the lung measuring 15 x 7 x 3.5. cm. The staple line measures 17 cm which is shaved and the bronchial. around inked blue. The pleura is gray pink and glistening and. mottled moderately with fine black streaks. Also noted is a precut. area on the pleura which reveals a sub pleural gray white firm. nodule, measuring 1 x 0.9 x 0.8 cm located 2 cm from the staple line. margin. The remainder of the bronchial is pink red blotchy and. crepitant. No other nodule is grossly identified. Frozen section is. performed on the nodule and resubmitted for permanent section. Representative section of the specimen and entire nodule are. submitted. 2. Part two is labeled 'left lower lobe wedge'. It consists of one. piece of yellow-pink soft tissue measuring 2 x 1 x 0.5 cm. Entirely. submitted in one cassette. 3. Part three is received fresh, labeled 'margin of left lower lobe. wedge'. It consists of a stapled strip of light tan tissue. measuring 3.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm. The staple line is shaved and the soft. tissue is submitted. 4. Part four is labeled 'level #5 lymph node'. It consists of. multiple soft red-black lymph nodes measuring 1.5 x 1.1 x 0.6 cm in. aggregate. Entirely submitted in one cassette. 5. Part five is labeled 'level #7 lymph node'. It consists of a 1.5. x 1 x 0.8 cm red-black lymph node. Entirely submitted in one. cassette. 6. Part six is labeled 'level #9 lymph node'. It consists of a 1.2. x 1 x 0.6 cm red-black lymph node. Entirely submitted in one. cassette. 7. Part seven is received fresh, labeled 'basilar segment left lower. lobe silk stitches on tumor location'. It consists of a segment of. lung measuring 20 x 14 x 4.5 cm. The bronchial margin measures 1.5. cm and the vascular margin measures 1 cm. The pleura is gray pink. glistening and mottled moderately with fine black streaks. There are. two staple lines measuring 8 cm and 5 cm in length. There is a. precut area on the pleura which is marked with a stitch. At this. area there is a grey tan firm mass, measuring 1.5 x 1 cm and located. 1.5 cm from the bronchial resection margin, and 0.4 cm from the. closest staple line which is shaved and the bronchial is inked. black. The mass is located on the mediastinal surface of the lung. The remaining of the bronchial is pink red blotchy and crepitant. No. other nodule is grossly identified. Representative sections of the. specimen and the entire mass area with adjacent tissue are. submitted.

Specimen #: RESULTS: Positive for a p.G12A (c.34G>C) mutation in codon 12 of. the KRAS gene. INTERPRETATION: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to. correlate with poor prognosis and resistance to tyrosine kinase. inhibitor therapies in patients with non-small lung cancer. COMMENT: KRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking. history. This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;. based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are. expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of. the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low. percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and. codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin. embedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been. established in samples of colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung. carcinoma which harbor these mutations, although several other. tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of. pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.). METHOD/LIMITATION: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single. nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;. primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. REFERENCES: NSCLC. Mascaux C, Iannino N, et al.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: A-C: See final diagnosis. D: Sections of the bladder show an invasive transitional cell carcinoma broadly. extending through the muscularis propria and into the perivesical fat (D1-4) The. corresponding, subjacent inked radial margin is negative for tumor. No definite. lymphovascular space invasion is identified. The adjacent urothelium along the. left lateral wall shows mild to moderate urothelial dysplasia. No carcinoma in. situ (flat lesion identified). Sections of the prostate show a unilateral prostatic adenocarcinoma, comprised. of variably sized glands infiltrating the fibromuscular stroma. The tumor is. predominantly along the left distal prostate (D19-20). No invasion into the. capsule or periprostatic soft tissue is identified. A few areas of atypical glands. are also seen in the right prostatic lobe (D15, D18) Two K903 stains performed. show intermittent staining of basal cells around critical glands, supporting. diagnoses of high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and atypical basal cell. hyperplasia. The apical urethral and radial margins as well as bilateral seminal. vesicles and vasa deferentia are all free of tumor. E-S: See final microscopic-diagnosis.

Part A: The specimen is received in formalin, labeled with the patient's. name, medical record number and ""RADICAL HYSTERECTOMY, BSO"", and consists of. a radical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingooophorectomy. The specimen. includes a uterus (90.0 grams, 8.0 cm in length x 4.5 cm cornu to cornu, 3.0. cm anterior to posterior), with a attached cervix (3.5 x 3 cm) and bilateral. adnexa. The right fallopian tube (5.0 cm in length x 0.4 cm in. circumference) is attached to a right ovary (2.5 x 1.7 x 0.3 cm). The left. fallopian tube (6.5 cm in length x 0.4 cm in circumference) is attached to a. left ovary (2.5 x 1.5 x 0.4 cm) Additionally, the specimen has a right. parametrium measuring 2.5 x 0.7 x 0.5 and 3.5 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm, respectively. The vagina cuff is surrounding the cervix and measures 1.5 cm in length. The serosa is tan-pink, smooth and glistening with focal areas of adhesions. mostly at the lower posterior aspect. The anterior aspect is distorted by. the presence of an intramural nodule (2.0 x 1.8 cm). The cervix has an. eroded surface (3. x 3.5 cm) with areas of hemorrhage predominantly between. 3 and 6 o'clock. Peripherally to this area the cervix is partially covered. by a tan-pink, smooth and glistening mucosa extending into the vaginal cuff. The cervical os (0.8 cm in greatest dimension) is irregular and is. surrounded by hemorrhagic irregular surface. The cervical canal (3.0 in. length x 0.8 cm circumference) has a tan-pink herringbone mucosa and a focal. area of irregularity with papillary like projection closest to the cervical. os which is extending into the cervical canal up to 2.0 cm. The endometrial. cavity (3.2 x 0.5 cm) is covered by a tan-pink, hemorrhagic endometrial. mucosa (0.1 cm in thickness) The fundic area has a polypoid lesion (1.0 x. 0.3 x 0.2 cm). The myometrium (1.5 to 1.2 cm in thickness) is red-brown,. with fine tan-white fibrous septation. There is a tan-white nodular mass. with a whorling cut appearance in the fundic area. No other discrete lesions. are grossly identified. Both fallopian tubes have a fimbriated end and the serosa is tan-pink,. smooth and glistening with paratubal cysts varying in size from 0.1 to 0.3. cm in greatest dimension and filled with a yellow clear serous fluid. Cross sectioning demonstrates tan-pink mucosa with a pinpoint lumen. No. discrete lesions are grossly identified. Both ovaries have a tan-pink to tan-yellow cerebroid-like appearance of the. external surface. Arising from both external surfaces, there are cystic. lesions measuring on the right side 0.7 x 0.7 cm and on the left 0.7 x 0.5. cm. The cysts are filled with a hemorrhagic serous fluid. Additional cystic. lesions are grossly seen in the periphery of both ovaries varying from 0.3. to 0.5 cm in greatest dimension. Ink Code: Blue anterior aspect, surgical resection margin.

Collected Date: Received Date/TIme: D. The specimen consists of a pancreatoduodenectomy specimen, with the segment of distal antrum and duodenum. measuring 27.0 cm in length. There is a shallow indurated ulcerated area, 2.5 cm distal from the pyloric valve, measuring. 1.8 X 1.0 cm. This appears to lie 1.5 cm proximal to the area of the ampulla of Vater. This indurated ulcer appears to be in. continuity with an area tumorous induration in the attached head of pancreas. The head of pancreas measures 6.0 X 4.5 X. 3.0 cm. The uncinate margin and pancreatle neck margin are identified and painted orange and blue respectively. The. common bile duct can be Identified at the superior surface of the pancreas, and continuity cannot be traced through the. dense tumorous tissue in the head of pancreas. At the ampullary reglon, there is a nodular thickening lying beneath the. mucosa, measuring approximately 1.8 X 1,0 X 1.0 cm. Part of the common bile duct can be identified, but the exact orifice. is not clearly evident. Transverse sectioning of the head of pancreas reveals a firm craggy area beneath the area of. duodenal ulceration, this tumorous zone is ill-defined, but measures approximately 2.5 x 1.5 X 2.5 cm. It appears. to. extend. close to the uncinate margin and possibly extend into peripancreatic tissue in the upper pancreaticoduodenal area. The. ulcerated duodenal wall is obscured. Further sectioning reveals small firm lymph nodes in the vicinity of the common bile duct, the superior margin, and the. pancreas as well as in the pancreatoduodenal region. Sections are taken as follows: D1. Pancreatic neck margin. D2,D3. Two halves of the superior transverse section of pancreas. D4,D5. Two halves of next transverse section of pancreas. D6,D7.

FSB. Bile Duct Margin: Negative for malignancy. FSC. Pancreatlc Margin: Negative for malignancy. Microscopic Description. A. The gallbladder shows chronic inflammation with mild irregularity of mucosal architecture. No cytologic atypia Is. present. B. Sections after routine processing confirm the frozen section diagnosis. Only a small segment of bile duct tissue is. present. The surface epithelium is partly denuded but residual epithellum shows no significant atypla and there is no. malignancy in this fragment. C. Sections after routine processing confirm the frozen section diagnosis. D. There is a widespread invasive pancreatic duct adenocarcinoma that shows a varied morphology, ranging from well-. defined angulated ductal structures through to areas where more solid sheets and small nodules and single cells with. prominent nuclear pleomorphism can be seen. The carcinoma erodes the common bile duct and focal areas on ductal. dyplasia are evident. Carcinoma is present in practically all of the sections taken. The extent of carcinoma thus exceeds. the extent of gross induration and It is estimated to have a size of at least 6,0 cm. Furthermore, carcinoma shows. extension beyond the pancreas Into peripancreatic tissue predominantly at the superior margin of the pancreas and in the. zone. between pancreas and duodenum. Carcinoma also invades into and through muscularis propria of the duodenum. and ulcerates the overlying duodenal mucosa, Carcinoma also focally involves the uncinate margin, and there are areas. where carcinoma encroaches on the cauterized soft tissue margin at the superior and posterior pancreaticoduodenal. area. There is prominent perineural invasion, and the section taken of the proximal common bile duct margin includes. carcinoma with perineural growth at this resection odge. There is prominent lymphovascular invasion in areas, and there is metastatic carcinoma in four of eleven lymph nodes. The proximal gastric and distal duodenal margins are unremarkable. The sections of the ampulla of Vater show. prominence of periductal glands and smooth muscle but no cytologic atypia or tumor. ACB: Collected Date: Received Date/Time: E.

Clinical History. The patient is a. vith a history of a pelvic mass, undergoing. resection of rectum and total. abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Gross Description. The specimen is received in six parts, each labeled with the patient's name and. medical record number. Parts A and C are received fresh, and Parts B, D-F are received in formalin. Part A is received fresh from the O.R., for frozen section, additionally labeled ""uterus,. cervix, ovaries,. rectum, and left ureter - FS,"" and consists of a composite resection specimen. including: uterus (5.5 cm. from superior to inferior, 5.0 cm cornu to cornu, and 3.5 cm anterior to posterior),. cervix (1.5cm X 1.0cm),. ovaries and fallopian tube, a segment of descending colon and rectum (23.0cm in. length X 3.0cm diameter). and an unattached segment of ureter (5.0cm in length X 0.3cm in diameter). Centered in the left adnexa is a 14.0 X 7.0 x 6.5 cm solid and cystic mass. The solid. portion (8.5 X 6.6 X 4.0. cm) is soft, pink-tan with areas of apparent necrosis, and comprises approximately. 40% of the mass. The. cystic portion of the mass is composed of multiple smooth walled cystic spaces. without excresences. No. residual ovary is identified in the mass. The solid portion infiltrates through the distal. portion of the. rectum with invasion through the rectal wall, ulceration of the mucosa, and. penetration into the lumen. The proximal and distal margins of the colon/rectum are free of tumor. Tumor. approaches to wthin 3.5cm. from the distal margin (rectum) and to within 10 cm of the proximal margin. (descending colon). The tumor. contains a cauterized surface near it's invasion into the rectum. The surgeon. indicates the separate. segment of left ureter was present adjacent to this cauterized area. Additionally,. tumor infiltrates into the. posterior wall of the uterus with invasion into but not through the myometrial wall. The uterine cavity. overlying the area of tumor invasion appears grossly unremarkable. The tumor does. not appear to involve. any other structures grossly. Two lymph nodes are found between the ovarian mass. and the rectum. Representative sections of the solid component of the mass and sections of tumor. infiltrating rectum are. submitted for frozen section diagnosis # 1 with the frozen remnants in cassettes A1-. A3. Additionally,. portions of the mass as well as uninvolved endomyometrium are submitted for. research. The uterus additionally shows multiple nodules, sub-mucosal and sub-serosal, with. firm, white-tan cut. surfaces showing a whorled appearance. These nodules range in size from 0.7 to. 2.2cm in maximal. diameter and do not appear to be associated with the adnexal mass. No areas of. hemorrhage, necrosis, or. cystic degeneration are identified in these nodules. The ectocervix (1.0 X 1.0 cm) has. a smooth white-tan. surface without focal lesions. The cervical os is fish-mouthed and measures 0.7 cm in. greatest dimension. The endocervix has glistening tan-brown mucosa and appears grossly unremarkable. The endometrium is. thin, tan-brown, and grossly appears atrophic. The right ovary is white-tan,. measures 2.5 X 1.5 X 0.8 cm. and shows no gross abnormalities. The right fallopian tube (4.5 cm length X 0.5 cm. diameter) appears. grossly unremarkable. The anatomic area of the left fallopian tube appears to consist. entirely of infiltrating. tumor and no residual fallopian tube is identified grossly. The separate portion of left. ureter is unoriented,. appears intact, and shows no evidence of involvement by tumor. Representative sections are submitted as follows: Cassettes A1-A3: Frozen section remnants. Cassette A4: Cervix, anterior and posterior. Cassette A5: Leiomyomata. Cassette A6: Endomyometrium.

Result of Her-2/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for Her-2/neu. oncoprotein overexpression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed on block A11 using the CB11. monoclonal antibody to. Her-2/neu oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 0 on a scale of. 0-3 with focal. cytoplasmic staining only. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 0 or 1 are considered negative for. overexpression of Her-2/neu. oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered borderline. We and others. have observed that. many carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with. staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore submitted for FISH testing. The results of. the FISH test are. issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for. overexpression of Her-2/neu. oncoprotein. Tumors in this category show an excellent correlation between the. results of. immunohistochemical and FISH testing, and almost always show gene amplification.

Both ends are stapled closed. The. serosa is smooth, tan-pink, and the stapled margins are inked black. The duodenum is opened and. reveals a stent in the ampulla and a 1.5 X 1-cm area of flattened mucosa with underlying palpable,. indurated mass 3 cm proximal to the ampulla. The proximal duodenal margin is removed entirely en. face and used for frozen section diagnosis and is resubmitted in toto. The pancreas measures 5.8 X 4 x 4. cm. The neck margin is inked blue, and the radial margin is inked black. On sectioning, a 4 X 3.8 x 3-cm,. ill-defined, indurated, white-yellow mass with clear tan, mucinous filled cystic spaces is identified in the. head of the pancreas, 0.6 cm to the neck. margin, approximately 0.2 the ampulla, and focally abuts the Adenocareenina, deatnos. cm to. black-inked radial margin, and grossly extends to the proximal duodenal Site Vancreas head. margin. The ill-defined mass surrounds the main pancreatic and common bile ducts;. however, both ducts are probe patent through the ampulla. The common bile. duct contains a blue stent. The ducts appear to enter the duodenum via. adjacent but separate ductal ampullae. Common bile duct at the margin is. dilated at 1 cm in diameter. The main pancreatic duct at the neck margin. is dilated up to 0.6 cm in diameter. Sectioning through the mass into the duodenum proximal to the ampulla. reveals the mass to extend grossly into the muscularis of the duodenum and. a clear, mucinous, fluid-filled space, 1.4 cm in greatest dimension,. subjacent to the flattened duodenal mucosal area. Sectioning and palpation of the peripancreatic fat reveals 14 possible. lymph nodes ranging in size from 0.3 cm in greatest dimension up to 1.2 cm. in greatest dimension. Additionally noted is a 4.2 X 3.2 X 0.6-cm, lymph. node versus splenule. All possible lymphoid tissue is submitted. Representative sections of the largest lymph node versus splenule are. submitted.

However, classic. oligodendroglioma differentiation is not seen. In addition, there are scattered moderately. to marked ly atypical cells seen throughout. No mitotic figures are seen and there is no. microvascular proliferation or necrosis. 2. Permanent section of the posterior margin demonstrates gray matter without. hypercellularity or atypical cells to suggest neoplastic infiltration. 3. Permanent section of the deep margin demonstrates gray matter without hypercellularity. or atypical cells to suggest neoplastic infiltration. 4. Permanent section of the anterior martin demonstrates gray matter without. hypercellularity or atypical cells to suggest neoplastic infiltration. 5. Permanent section of the superior margin demonstrates gray matter without. hypercellularity or atypical cells to suggest neoplastic infiltration. 6. Permanent section of the inferior margin demonstrates gray and white matter. There is. not sufficient hypercellularity and no atypical cells are seen to suggest infiltrating. neoplasm. 8. Sections demonstrate gray and white matter with infiltrating neoplasm as previously. described. The tumor in this area does not demonstrate significantly greater hypercellularity. or atypical. Again, no mitotic figures and no microvascular proliferation or necrosis are seen. Addendum discussion: MIB-1 immunohistochemistry is performed on both the nonenhancing and enhancing portions of. the tumor. The former demonstrates only a few scattered MIB-1 positive cells. The average. index is <0.1% and the highest area is calculated at 1.6%. In contrast, the enhancing area. demonstrates many MIB-1 reactive cells. In the highest areas, a labeling index of 5.0% is. calculated. This level of activity is indicative of moderate proliferation coupled with the contrast. enhancement is worrisome for early anaplastic progression. However, the overall histologic. features are inadequate to classify this tumor as Grade Ill/anaplastic. Final Addendum Diagnosis: 1.

The cervical biopsy (#1) shows fragments of gland-forming adenocarcinoma admixed with. fragments of carcinoma with solid non-glandular growth pattern and high mitotic rate. Some. of the fragments may contain a component of endocervical adenocarcinoma in situ; the degree. of back-to-back glandular confluency in one of the fragments, however, is diagnostic of. invasive adenocarcinoma. Both the gland-forming and solid components of tumor show strong. immunoreactivity for p16 compatible with endocervical primary.

The tumour extends for a depth of 22mm and. is. very close to the left lateral soft tissue circumferential resection margin. Elsewhere, on the right side of the urethral orifice is an area of mucosal. irregularity 15 x 12mm. MICROSCOPY. The tumour seen in the left lateral wall of the bladder is a sarcomatoid variant. of transistional cell carcinoma/high grade urothelial carcinoma. The tumour is. composed predominantly of high grade malignant spindle cells with no. heterologous elements evident. Superficially, the morphology of the tumour is. more reminiscent of a solid conventional high grade urothelial carcinoma and. there is some overlying carcinoma in situ from which the tumour appears to be. arising. There is no definite evidence of lymphovascular invasion. The tumour invades through the muscularis propria into the perivessicular fat. (pT3) and is 2mm from the circumferential resection margin at its closest point. (block 3B). The macroscopically abnormal area near the bladder neck shows evidence of oedema. and increased vascularity associated with urothelial hyperplasia. There is some. patchy dysplasia in this area which just amounts to CIS in a few foci. The. prostatic urethra shows evidence of similar oedema and increased vascularity. associated with von Brunn's nests and hyperplasia but there is no evidence of. dysplasia and the prostatic resection margin is clear of neoplasia. The prostate, vas deferens and seminal vesicles show no significant abnormality. The left and right distal ureteric resection margins (specimens 1 and 2) show no. definite evidence of carcinoma in situ. SUMMARY. Cystoprostatectomy: Sarcomatoid variant of high grade urothelial carcinoma. (G3,pT3). 2mm clearance from left lateral circumferential resection margin. Adjacent carcinoma-in-situ.

CLINICAL : Malignant mesothelioma left pleura. MACROSCOPIC: An irregular strip of pleura 130 X 120 X 2mm. The surface is studded by several. irregular firm nodules measuring up to 10mm in diameter. Also submitted are. three separate strips of fibrous tissue the largest 30 x 10mm and the smallest. 20 X 10mm. BLOCK KEY: 1-6:Largest pleural fragment, :Sections from smaller pleural fragments. MICROSCOPIC: The sections show strips of pleura composed of fibrous connective tissue and. adipose tissue. Both tissue components show infiltration by a malignant. mesothelioma. Most of the tumour is of epithelioid type, being composed of. neoplastic. epithelial cells displaying tubulopapillary architecture and forming. irregular nodules. The neoplastic cells have large irregular nuclei with fine. chromatin,. prominent nucleoli and moderate to abundant amounts of eosinophilic. cytoplasm with often distinct cellular boundaries. There is moderate nuclear. pleomorphism. Apoptotic cells are present and mitotic figures are easily. identified. Focally the neoplasm is less cellular and displays increased amounts of fibrous. connective tissue. The constitutive cells in these areas are spindled in shape. and constitute the sarcomatoid component. Elsewhere the neoplastic cells are. separated by varying amounts of myxoid-appearing stroma. Interspersed are occasional nodular areas containing birefringent inorganic. material in keeping with tale particles. In association are epithelioid. histiocytes and occasional multinucleated foreign body-type giant cells. At the. periphery of the tumour is a moderately dense chronic inflammatory cell. infiltrate consisting predominantly of lymphocytes. There is accompanying. lymphoid aggregate formation. Some of the tissue strips show paucicellular areas composed of dense collagen,. most likely representing part of a pleural plaque. A single section shows blood. clot containing aggregates of neoplastic mesothelial cells. The PAS reaction with diastase digestion for mucin is negative. The Alcian blue. stain is positive in the areas of myxoid stroma. Immunohistochemistry: The epithelioid malignant cells are positive for cytokeratin 5/6, calretinin and. WT-1 and show strong peripheral membranous staining for EMA. The sarcomatoid. malignant cells are positive for calretinin and negative for CK5/6 and WT-1 and. show patchy cytoplasmic and membranous staining for EMA. Staining for BerEP4. and CEA is negative.

Received is a left modified radial. mástectomy specimen consisting of skin, breast tissue and attached axillary. tail. The skin ellipse measures 21 x 10.5 cm. The nipple and areola are. located centrally on this. The nipple is retracted. There is a partially. healed incision site running circumferentially around the lateral areola from. approximately the 1:00 to the 4:00 position which measures 4 cm in length. No. additional skin lesions are noted. The underlying breast tissue measures 23 x. 13 x 7 cm. Margins are inked blue, and the specimen is serially sectioned. There is a large, grossly apparent tumor in the upper outer quadrant which is. extremely firm, gray-tan, infiltrates into surrounding breast tissue, and. measures 2.6 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm. This tumor grossly extends to within 1.3 cm of. the deep surgical margin. This lesion will be designated as ""lesion #1. Further sectioning demonstrates a healing biopsy site subjacent to the areola,. located at the junction between upper and lower outer quadrants. In this. region, the biopsy cavity measures up to 2.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. At the nipple,. in the region of retraction, there is firm, white tumor; there is also diffuse. firmness about the biopsy cavity suspicious for residual tumor in an area. measuring 2.8 cm in greatest dimension. This measures 4.0 cm from the deep. margin of resection and is distinctly separate from the previously described. lesion. The second area of abnormality shall be designated as ""lesion #2.'. Further sectioning in the left lower outer quadrant reveals a third nodule;. this is firm, gray, infiltrates into surrounding fibrous parenchyma, and. measures 1.0 cm in greatest dimension. It measures 3.5 cm from the deep. surgical margin, and is distinctly separate from the other two nodules. This. shall be designated as ""lesion #3."".

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION: Sectoions of lesion #1 of the left breast show infiltrating duct carcinoma. Tumor cells are arranged as tubules and in nests, and infiltrate into. surrounding fibrous stroma and fat with accompanying desmoplastic response. There is a moderate degree of nuclear pleomorphism. Focally, comedo and. cribriform intraductal carcinoma is present in association with this mass. (A7), although this intraductal component is minor. Sections of lesion #2 of the left breast show tumor which predominantly has. the appearance of infiltrating lobular carcinoma, with tumor infiltrating in. linear ""indian file"" rows. Nuclei are relatively small and bland. There is. extensive infiltration of areolar smooth muscle and fibrous parenchyma, as. well as extensive perineural invasion. In several small foci, small tubles of. neoplastic cells are present. There are several foci of associated. intraductal carcinoma with cancerization of lobules/ lobular carcinoma in. situ. Sections of lesion #3 of the left breast show a lesion with a papillary. appearance; in most areas, this appears to be an intraductal process, although. 2 of 4. in one area an associated component of invasive duct carcinoma is seen. Papillomas are present in adjacent breast tissue. DIAGNOSIS: A. ""LEFT BREAST AND AXILLA"": LEFT BREAST WITH THREE SEPARATE FOCI OF BREAST CARCINOMA.

Study of the. sections confirms the intraoperative findings. The sections include cortex and. white matter, extensively effaced by formations of a diffuse oligodendroglioma. neoplasm. In many areas the oligodendroglioma has low grade appearances, where. it involves both cortex and white matter, and demonstrates 'classical''. oligodendroglial morphology.

TCGA-77-8156,"Histopathology Report. HISTORY. Left upper lobectomy. SPN - FNAC - malignant. MACROSCOPIC. Three specimens submitted: 1: The first specimen is labelled 'left upper lobe lung' and consists of a lobe. of lung that measures 150 mm SI, 140 mm AP and 65 mm ML. The hilar margin is. inked blue. The specimen has been previously sectioned for research. The. pleural surface is slightly haemorrhagic and there is a puckered area measuring. 35 X 35 mm on the superior lateral pleural aspect. A bullous is present in the. anterior superior aspect of the lung. On sectioning the lung, there is a round. tumour with a tan and black cut surface with infiltrating edges in the superior. aspect of the lobe that measures 45 mm AP, 30 mm ML and 35 mm SI. The tumour. abuts the pleural surface at the previously noted puckering. The tumour is 15. mm from the hilar margin and more then 20 mm from the bronchial resection. margin. The remainder of the lung shows marked emphysematous changes. [1A: bronchial resection margin; 1B: 4 lymph nodes; 1C-1E: tumour and pleura; 1F: tumour and adjacent lymph node; 1G: emphysematous lung; 1H: more normal lung. inferiorly.]. 2: The second specimen is labelled 'left hilar lymph node' and consists of. three pieces of tan fibrous tissue, the largest measuring 30 x 18 x 10 mm. All. three pieces contain hemorrhagic lymph nodes containing carbon pigment. The. largest lymph node measures 25 X 10 X 8 mm. [2A-2B: rep section of each node.]. 3: The third specimen is labelled ""mediastinal lymph node' and consists of a. single piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 24 x 14 x 10 mm. The tissue. contains a lymph node measuring 9 x 6x5 mm. [3A, tissue bisected.]. MICROSCOPIC. 1: Sections reveal a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma.

PRE-OP DIAGNOSIS: Hepatic cancer. FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS. A. Right lobe of liver, partial resection: Tumor at margin. B. Right lobe of liver, additional margin: Margin negative. (superior). GROSS DESCRIPTION. A. The specimen is received fresh for frozen section and. tissue procurement labeled ""right lobe of liver"" and. consists of a 493 gram, 14.0 x 11.0 x 5.5 cm. partial hepatectomy. specimen described as ""right lobe"". The cauterized parenchymal. margin measures 13.0 x 6.2 cm. There is a large obvious gross tumor. mass opposite to that margin. A double suture is present at one. aspect and a frozen section of that area is requested. The. parenchymal margin is inked black; a fleshy yellow to tan nodular. irregular area consisting of tumor mass which measures 9.0 x 12.0 x. 6.0 cm. Abutting this mass are other irregular tumor nodules which. measure a combined 3 cm. in greatest dimension. Separate from the. largest mass is a 2 cm. nodule which is present directly at the. suture which was requested for frozen section. A representative. section of that margin with attached tissue is submitted for frozen. section as frozen section AFS-1. Representative sections of tumor. and normal are submitted for tissue procurement. Representative. sections are submitted in 10 blocks as labeled. BLOCK SUMMARY: 1-3 - Tumor to inked resection margin; 4-6 - tumor. to capsular surface; 7-9 - tumor to normal parenchyma; 10 - random. normal parenchyma. Please note, photographs are taken. B. Received fresh labeled ""additional lobe of liver"" is a. 670 gram, 14.0 X 4.0 x 4.5 cm. hepatectomy specimen with a. double long suture oriented as superior and a single long stitch. oriented as anterior which is hepatic capsular surface. The double. long stitch margin is inked black and the inferior side is inked red. for orientation. That inferior side represents the tissue adjacent. to specimen A. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal pale. tannish areas adjacent to the prior resection which may represent. residual tumor. The area adjacent to the single long stitch. designated anterior is inked orange. The superior margin is sampled. in frozen sections 1 and 2 and the area adjacent to the stitch. defined as anterior margin which appeared more capsular is submitted. as representative frozen section AFS3. Representative sections. after fixation. RS8. Representative sections are submitted for. frozen section with blocks BFS1 and BFS2 representing the new. superior margin and BFS3 representing the ""single stitch anterior. margin"" which appears to be hepatic capsule. Representative. sections are submitted in eight blocks as labeled. BLOCK SUMMARY: 1-3 - Remainder of anterior margin (subsequently. inked orange); 4-8 - representative from remainder of specimen. documenting surfaces subsequently inked red (portion previously. contiguous with part A) and black (apparent cauterized resection. margin) . RR1-5 additional sections contiguous with part A. A&B. Microscopic examination of the right lobe of liver partial. hepatectomy: Histologic type: Hepatocellular carcinoma with solid, trabecular and. clear cell patterns. Histologic grade: Grade 3 of 4. Tumor size: The main tumor mass is 12 cm. in greatest dimension and. abutting additional irregular tumor nodules measuring a combined 3. cm. Primary tumor (pT) : Multiple nodules with size greater than 12 cm. (pT3a). Margins of resection: Tumor was present at the original superior. resection margin of part A. The final resection margins of part B. are negative. Vascular invasion: Lymphatic space invasion is identified in block. A7 and A5. No large vessel invasion is identified. Regional lymph nodes (pN) : Not evaluated, pNx. Distant metastasis (pM) : Not evaluated, pMx. Other findings: Special stains and immunohistochemical stains were. evaluated on block A1. The tumor showed the expected loss of. reticulin staining that one sees in hepatocellular carcinoma. The. tumor showed the usual canalicular spotty staining with CEA. The. tumor cells were completely negative for CK7, CK20 and CK8. The. tumor cells were also negative for HepPar 1. Although HepPar 1 is usually positive in hepatocellular carcinoma,. higher grade tumors can be negative and that is the finding in this. case. The background hepatic parenchyma shows findings of steatohepatitis. with approximately 30-40% mixed micro- and macrosteatosis with. chronic inflammation in the portal areas and mild chronic. inflammation within the hepatic lobules. Overall, the findings are. those of moderate steatohepatitis. Stage I fibrosis is noted in the. background hepatic parenchyma. No iron accumulation is identified. No PAS positive diastase resistant alpha-1 antitripsin globules are. identified. Iron, PAS, PAS with diastase, reticulin and trichrome. stains were evaluated on a representative normal tissue block (A10). Dr. also reviewed selected slides and concurred with the. diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma and grade 3 interpretation. Of note, no definitive additional tumor was identified in specimen. B.

SPECIAL PROCEDURES: INTRA - OPERATIVE CONSULTATION: 1. Lung, right upper lobe: wedge resection (FS). - Invasive adenocarcinoma. Intra-Operative Consultation #1 performed by. ADDENDUM #1: This addendum documents the results of our immunohistochemical. stains for Part 1. The tumor cells are positive for CK7, TTF-1 and. Napsin-A while negative for CK20 and CDX-2, supporting the. diagnosis. The original diagnosis remains otherwise unchanged. Addendum #1 performed by. ADDENDUM #2 FOR MOLECULAR TESTS: KRAS, EGFR and ALK FISH were sent on. The test is to be performed on. The case report, slides, and blocks for the cited. accession number were retrieved from archives. The pathologist whose. signature appears below reviewed the original pathology report,. examined candidate H&E slides, and selected block 1C appropriate to. the specifications of the ordered molecular analysis. x1 H&E and x9. unstained slides were prepared and forwarded to. vhere the subject molecular test will be performed. An. addendum report will be issued when the results of this molecular. test are available. Addendum #2 performed by. ADDENDUM 3: Integrated Oncology. MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY. KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS. RESULTS: Positive for a p.G12C (c.34G>T) mutation in codon 12 of. the KRAS gene. INTERPRETATION: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to. correlate with poor prognosis and resistance to tyrosine kinase. inhibitor therapies in patients with non-small lung cancer. COMMENT: KRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking. history. This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;. based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are. expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of. the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low. percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and. codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin. embedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been. established in samples of colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung. carcinoma which harbor these mutations, although several other. tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of. pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.). METHOD/LIMITATION: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single. nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and. 13;. primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. REFERENCES: NSCLC. Mascaux C, Iannino N, et al.

Addendum #3 performed by. ADDENDUM # 4: EGFR Mutation Analysis. Body Site: Right upper lobe of lung. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma, mucinous type. RESULTS: No mutation detected. INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified in the sample provided. for analysis. Fewer than 5% of non-small cell lung carcinoma. patients without identifiable mutations are reported to be. responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies. COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal. for this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 80% tumor. cellularity upon pathologist review. A frequently occurring sequence change 2361>GA (Q787Q) was. identified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical. significance. Mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth. factor receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with. differential responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase. inhibitor (TKI) therapies. The objective response rate among. patients with a sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%. This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;. based on the current literature, most mutations in non-small-cell. lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons. Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be. detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change. during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this. result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation. in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor. This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The. clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types. is unknown. METHOD: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by. bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. REFERENCES: 1. Azzoli CG, et al.

By convention, the neoplasm is considered to be a. bilateral primary ovarian neoplasm; however, the involvement of the. mucosa of both fallopian tubes by carcinoma (in addition to the outer. aspects of the fallopian tubes which are involved tumor), the. possibility of synchronous primary tubal neoplasms are also. considered. The carcinoma consists of multiple components, including. serous carcinoma, carcinoma with transitional or pseudotransitional. features, endometrioid carcinoma, anaplastic carcinoma, and a small. subpopulation of tumor cells exhibiting cytoplasmic clearing. Tumor-. associated necrosis is present in both ovaries, as well as in. multiple other metastatic sites. Secondary acute and chronic. inflammatory changes are present in both ovaries and many of the. metastatic sites. Lymphovascular invasion by carcinoma is present in. most of the involved sites. Adhesions and secondary reactive. mesothelial change are noted in many of the involved sites. The. preliminary pathologic findings were communicated to. on. HISTORY: Pelvic mass; ovarian cancer.

No tumor cells are identified on the H&E stains of the sentinel lymph nodes. Immunostains for keratin were performed on each. of the sentinel nodes (A1-A2, B1-B2), and a single keratin-positive cell suspicious for an isolated tumor cell is present on one of. the keratin stains from sentinel node #1 (A2). A single cluster of tumor cells is noted within a dilated lymphatic channel next to the tumor. Because the channel is quite. dilated and only a single focus is identified, it is unclear whether this represents true peritumoral lymphovascular invasion or. displacement artifact. Tumor marker studies including FISH for HER2 gene copy level were reported previously (see.

Microscopic Description: The stides labeled. are examined. See diagnosis. Final Diagnosis. Right lung, lower lobe (wedge biopsy): Tumor characteristics: Procedure: Wedge biopsy. Specimen integrity: Intact. Specimen laterality: Right. Specimen site: Right lower lobe. Tumor size: 2.3 cm in greatest diameter. Tumor focality: Unifocal. Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma with associated fibrosis (see. comment). Histologic grade: Moderately differentiated. Visceral pleural invasion: Carcinoma extends up to but not through. visceral pleura. Lymphovascular space invasion: Foci highly suspicious for. lymphovascular space invasion. identified. Surgical margin status: Carcinoma extends to within 1 mm of the staple line on this wedge. resection (see comment). Other: Emphysematous changes.

Level 9 lymph node, right lung, specimen four (biopsy): Reactive sinus histiocytosis, lymphoid hyperplasia and. anthracosilicosis, no metastatic. carcinoma identified within one lymph node (0/1). Level 4 lymph node, right lung, specimen five (biopsy): Fragmented lymph nodes demonstrating reactive sinus histiocytosis,. lymphoid hyperplasia,. and anthracosilicosis, no metastatic carcinoma identified (see. comment). pTN stage: pT1b NO. Comments. This is staged as a pT1b NO carcinoma based on a size of 2.3 cm. in. greatest diameter and negative lymph nodes. The final stage should. be performed in conjunction with the clinical history. The carcinoma. is a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with areas of fibrosis. suggestive of a so-called scar carcinoma. Although the overall. histology is consistent with a lung primary, the possibility of. metastasis should be ruled out clinically. The carcinoma extends up. to but not into or through the visceral pleura. Clinical correlation. and follow up is recommended. The frozen section diagnosis is confirmed. Specimen five was received fragmented and, therefore, an accurate. node count cannot be performed. At the request of the undersigned pathologist, these slides have. been additionally reviewed by Dr. who concurs with the. diagnosis. This test has been finalized at the.

OMENTUM #3 (PARTIAL OMENTECTOMY): -Omental adipose tissue with tiny fibrous adhesions and few reactive mesothelial cells. -No tumor identified. COMMENT: The tumor exhibits glandular/poorly differentiated glandular, squamous. (nonkeratinizing), and undifferentiated features. The poorly differentiated endometrioid. component shows glandular, trabecular/cord-like and nested growth patterns and is considered. architectural grade 3. The undifferentiated component shows solid sheets of monotonous, small to. intermediate size cells with scant cytoplasm, open chromatin, and frequent mitoses. In an effort to. further characterize the tumor, several immunostains were performed on blocks B4 and B14. Only. rare cells in the undifferentiated component stain positive for keratin AE 1/3, MOC 31, or BER-. EP4 (in contrast to the staining seen in the endometrioid component). Stains for cytokeratin 7,. CAM 5.2, vimentin, WT1, ER, PR, chromogranin, and synaptophysin are negative in the. undifferentiated tumor component. Some undifferentiated tumor cells stain for p53 and a few stain. for p16. The lymph node profiles show prominent sinus histiocytosis (virtually negative. immunostaining for epithelial markers in the undifferentiated tumor component precludes. application of these antibodies to search for occult tumor cells in the lymph nodes). Based on these. specimens, pathologic staging is assigned as pT2b NO. Reference: Altrabulsi B, Malpica A, Deavers MT, et al. Unidfferentiated carcinoma of the. endometrium. Am j Surg Pathol 2005;29(10):1316-1321. Findings were discussed with. HISTORY: ""Clear cell endometrial cancer"". MICROSCOPIC: Stain for WT1 is also negative in the endometrioid component of the tumor. Additional immunostains will be. reported in an addendum. SPECIAL STUDIES: Decalcification (J2).

The endocervical canal is 4.0 cm in length. The endometrial cavity measures. 8.0 cm in length and up to 7.7 cm in width. The myometrium measures up to 3.6 cm in thickness. The anterior and posterior endometrium is almost entirely replaced by friable red-tan fungating tumor that measures. 14.0 x 7.7 cm in surface area and almost fills the endometrial cavity. The tumor extends into the lower uterine. segment and cervical canal in the posterior aspect and is within 1.0 cm in the transformation zone. The tumor. invades into the superficial half of the lower uterine segment/cervix (to within 0.7 cm of the serosal surface). The. main volume of the tumor is in the endometrial cavity and shows maximum invasion of approximately two-thirds of. the uterine wall (within 1.9 cm of the serosa at the superior most aspect of the uterus). Within the uterus there is one well-circumscribed intramural leiomyoma measuring 2.5 x 2.2 x 1.8 cm. The cut. surface is gray-white firm and whorled without evidence of hemorrhage, necrosis, or calcification. The external. cervical os, the transformation zone, and the anterior endocervical canal are grossly unremarkable. The uninvolved. mucosa is pink-tan and soft with focal pinpoint hemorrhage.

Histologic sections of the parts 2 (portion of 6th rib) and part 3 (portion of 5th rib) demonstrate. unremarkable bone and bone marrow. ADDENDUM. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization studies performed on the squamous cell carcinoma shows. a ratio of EGFR gene to the centromere of dhromosome 7 of 1.02 indicating no EGFR. amplification in the targeted region. The rate of hyperploidy for the centromere of. chromosome 7 was 48.0% of the analyzed cells. The signal to nucleus ratio (SNR) for the. EGFR gene was 2.3. Interpretation guidelines for EGFR Gene Copy Number by FISH: Ratio of EGFR to the centromere of chromosome 7: Less than 2.0: No EGFR amplification. Greater than 2.0: EGFR amplification. Hyperploidy: Greater than two centromere copies/cell. SNR: The average number of EGFR signals per analyzed cell within the targeted region.

LEFT PERITHYROIDAL SOFT TISSUE; INCISIONAL BIOPSY: DIFFUSE LARGE B-CELL LYMPHOMA. GROSS DESCRIPTION. Received fresh is an irregular piece of tissue labelled as ""left thyroid region"". measuring 1.3 x 1.2 x 0.7cm, which i.s divided into 4 pieces. One piece. measuring 1.1 x 0.7 x 0.3cm is snap-frozen for storage. Subsequently received in formalin and labelled with patient's decails is a. specimen designated as left thyroid region'. It consists of two pieces of. pinkish, fleshy tissue measuring 1 x 0.7 x 0.6 cm and 1 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm with. minimal amounts of surrounding fatty tissue, submitted entirely. (A1; no. reserve). MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION. Histology shows predominantly extrathyroidal connective tissue harbouring a. diffuse, patternless infiltrate of lymphomatous cells, where best preserved. appearing medi.um-to-large, with ""open"" vesicular nuclei and discernible. nucleoli, enclosed in moderate amounts of cytoplasm, sometimes with a. plasmacytoid nuance, infiltrating in-between residual skeletal muscle fibres and. adipocytes. No epithelial malignancy, granulomas or necrosis is seen. The lymohomatous infiltrate recapitulates its CD20/bcl-6/MUM.1 and bcl-2(+). reactive CD3(+) f-lymphocytes, which are scattered and few, hence excluding. Burkitt lymphom.a in conjunction with a cell proliferation fraction that falls. well below 100% (approximately 70-80% by Ki-67 immunolabelling), despite. urrently-discernible coexpression of germinal centre-associated CD10, albeit. variable and mostly weak.

TCGA-78-7540,"LEFT LOWER LOBE. Clinical Notes: LL lobectomy. Bronchoalveolar carcinoma on FNA. Two specimens received: 1: LEFT LOWER LOBE. Macroscopy: Specimen consists of a left lower lobectomy which measures 130 X 65 X 90 mm. The pleura overlying. the anterior basal segment is puckered and shows a small amount of adherent pale tissue. On. sectioning the lung in this area, there is diffuse infiltration by pale and tan tumour which has a rubbery. cut surface. The tumour appears to abut the lateral and diaphragmatic pleural surfaces. The lesion. measures approximately 50. X 60 X 45 mm. The tumour also involves the posterior lateral basal and. anterior basal segments. Tumour appears to surround a major segmental bronchus and extends close. to the bronchial resection margin. The tumour does not appear to involve the medial margin. [Tumour and diaphragmatic pleura, A; tumour and medial pleural surface, B; tumour and lateral. pleural surface, C-D; bronchial resection margin, E; tumour and bronchus immediately adjacent to. bronchial resection margin, F; hilar nodes, G; non-neoplastic lung, H.]. Microscopy: Sections show a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma with a prominent mucinous bronchiolo-alveolar. carcinoma component. Focally the tumour appears to be invasive. It closely abuts the pleural surface. Overlying this there is a thick organising fibrinous pleurisy. Although definite invasion of the pleura is. not seen, there are suspicious features and special stains will be performed. No vascular or perineural. invasion is seen. Small satellite deposits of tumour are scattered throughout the adjacent parenchyma. These are also identified in the parenchyma of the section taken of the bronchus immediately adjacent. to the bronchial resection margin (Block F). Both the bronchial resection margin and the bronchus. within the immediately adjacent section show no evidence of malignancy. No metastases to hilar. lymph nodes are seen. The lung tissue away from the mass in block H shows no specific abnormality. 2: HILAR LYMPH NODE. Macroscopy: Specimen consists of a single piece of grey firm tissue which measures 12 X 5 X 5 mm. Microscopy: Sections of the lymph node show carbon deposition and sinus histiocytosis but no evidence of. metastatic malignancy. Summary: Left lower lobe and hilar lymph node: 1. Invasive well-differentiated adenocarcinoma with a predominant bronchiolo-alveolar carcinoma. (mucinous type) pattern. 2. Pleura probably not involved by carcinoma but confirmatory stains are being performed. 3. No vascular or perineural invasion or lymph node metastases are seen. 4.

Right frontal brain mass. ~oeration/Specimen: A: Brain, Right frontal lesion, excision biopsy. : Brain, right frontal, excision biopsy. PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS: A, B. Brain, right frontal, excision: 1. Glioblastoma, with recent hemorrhage. 2. MIB-1 proliferation index: 60%. See Microscopy Description and Comment. COMMENT. The specimens are fragments of cerebrum that are infiltrated and extensively. effaced by a glial neoplastic proliferation that has proclivity for the white. matter. The neoplastic cells are small, elongated naked nuclei. There is. brisk mitotic activity with a very high proliferation index of about 60%. There is prominent microvascular cellular proliferation and zones of tumor. necrosis, some with pseudopalisading Within the tumor and adjacent brain. tissue there is recent hemorrhage. The morphology and immunophenotype are characteristic of a glioblastoma that. has undergone recent bleeding. OCEDURES/ADDENDA. MGMT Promoter Methvlation. Interpretation. EGATIVE: No evidence of methylated MGMT promoter is detected. Results-Comments. Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block. TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter. have been shown to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents. Assessment of. MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA followed. by real-time PCR amplification (MethyLight) of methylated and unmethylated DNA. sequences. FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a. stand alone diagnostic test. This test was developed and its performance. characteristies determined by the. laboratory as. required by CLIA 1 regulations. it has not been cleared or approved for. specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) The FDA has. determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These results are. provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted only in. the context of established procedures and/or diagnostic criteria. icerpretation. POSITIVE - EGFRVIII mutation is detected. Results-Comments. TEST DESCRIPTION: Testing performed on RNA extracted from tumor paraffin block. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an attractive molecular target. in glioblastoma because it is amplified, overexpressed, and/or mutated in up. to 40% to 50% of patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant III. (EGFRVIII) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR that is. commonly expressed in glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of. glioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRVIII as defining prognostically distinct. subgroups of glioblastomas. Additionally, the presence of EGFRVIII has been. shown to sensitize tumors to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the tumor. suppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from formalin fixed,. paraffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to cDNA. The cDNA is. then amplified using standard PCR technique for DNA templates. PCR products. are detected by gel electrophoresis. The limit of detection of this assay has. been determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal cells. FDA Comment: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a. stand alone diagnostic test. This test was develoned and its performance. characteristics determined by the.

By this signature, I attest that the above diagnosis is based upon my personal. examination of the slides(and/or other material indicated in the diagnosis). Microscopic Description and Comment: Sections of the left ovary show preservation of the normal. architecture with focal microscopic surface implants of. adenocarcinoma. The tumor focally contains prominent numbers. of. psammoma bodies. Identical surface implants of adenocarcinoma are. present on the left and right fallopian tubes, and on the serosal. surfaces of the uterus, cervix, and appendix. The omentum is also. diffusely involved by metastatic adenocarcinoma. There is no. evidence of a primary malignancy in the ovary, fallopian tubes,. endometrium, or cervix. The findings of multifocal microscopic tumor implants largely. limited to the surfaces of the left ovary and fallopian tubes is. F. highly suggestive of metastatic involvement of these structures. A. similar pattern of multifocal surface involvement was seen in this. patient's prior right oophorectomy specimen. Overall,. the findings of a widely metastatic adenocarcinoma displaying. papillary serous differentiation with no demonstrable genital. tract primary is most suggestive of a nrimarvperitoneal serous. neoplasm. History: The patient is. a. 1 with surface adenocarcinoma. involving the right ovary and omentum. Diagnosis: As above. Operative procedure: Examination under anesthesia, exploratory. laparotomy, total abdominal hysterectomy and left. salpingo-oophorectomy, debulking, omentectomy, and appendectomy. An intraoperative non-microscopic consultation was obtained and. interpreted as: ""Uterus, cervix, LSO, right tube - Hysterectomy. specimen comprised of the stated structure; no gross neoplasm left. ovary or endometrium; fallopian tubes mildly edematous, but not. significantly enlarged; uterine serosa shaggy in some areas;. normal ovarian tissue taken for tissue bank,'.

The specimen is received in four containers of formalin, each. labelled with the patient's name. The first container is labelled. ""uterus, cervix, LSO, R tube"" and contains a 270 gram TAH/LSO and. right salpingectomy specimen. The uterine fundus has a length of. 6.5 cm, a maximal width of 5.7 cm, and a maximal A-P dimension of. 4.3 cm. Its outer surface is focally covered with shaggy tan and. brown fibrous adhesions that display no nodularity. The. myometrium ranges in thickness from 1.7 cm at the level of the. lower uterine segment to 2.5 cm at the level of the mid fundus. It contains a single well-circumscribed, 0.5 x 0.5 cm firm white. smooth muscle nodule in the left fundic wall. Otherwise, it is. composed of the usual firm tan smooth muscle tissue with no gross. abnormalities. The endometrium displays a uniform thickness of. 0.3 cm. It is composed of the usual soft, tan, velvety tissue. with no areas of nodularity. The cervical cross-sectional area. is 3.5 x 3.5 cm, and the cervical length is 3.0 cm. The. ectocervix and endocervix are covered by glistening tan and white. mucosa with no areas of nodularity or ulceration. The left ovary. is 4 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm.

The tumor has very prominent nuclear. atypia; however, other features of anaplasia such as mitotic figures,. microvascular cellular proliferation or necrosis are absent. A MIB-1 immunoperoxidase stain is requested and a complementary report. will follow. ADDENDUM REPORT: Special stain: A MIB-1 immunoperoxidase stain was performed on block. #3.

Representative (50%) sections,. #'sl and 2. Part 3 ""Right frontal lobe, is a portion of cerebrum; 7 x 5.5 x. 3.2 cm. On the convexity and 3 cm from 1 margin of resection, there. is. a reddish discoloration. A sagittal section at this level discloses. hemorrhage and softening of tissue about 2.5 cm in diameter. The. entire specimen is firm and the cut surfaces are grayish-white.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: 2. Portions of cerebral cortex and white mater extensively. infiltrated. by a neoplasm with morphological features similar to those described. for the previous specimen. However in less infiltrated areas of the. cortex, where abundant neuropil is still identifiable, the neoplastic. cells display naked round nuclei, not infrequently surrounded by a. clear halo. Mitotic figures are difficult to be identified, and. microvascular cellular proliferation or necrosis are absent. 3. Sections from the central nodular portion of the lesion. demonstrate. focal areas with a frank astrocytic phenotype next to nodular areas of. oligodendroglioma made-up of tumor cells with large, hyperchromatic. nuclei surrounded by halos and well defined cell membranes. In the. central area of the specimen, there are irregularly shaped cystic. spaces surrounded by rarified white matter with neoplastic glial cells. and focal secretion of mucinous material. These spaces become. confluent and form larger cysts. The entire specimen is permeated. throughout by neoplastic cells with oligodendroglial characteristics. usually with some preservation of the neuropil or white matter,. occasionally with formation of nodules. In relationship with the more. cellular areas, there are vessels cuffed by mononuclear inflammatory. cells, which are seen permeating the wall of some of these vessels. Mitotic figures are difficult to be found, and areas of microvascular. cellular proliferation or necrosis are absent. The tumor is present. in. all margins of resection. SPECIAL STAINS: MIB-1 immunoperoxidase stain was performed on blocks. 1. and 8. A MIB-1 labelling index of 1% was determined on block #8. representing the bulk of the neoplasm. A labelling index of 8% was. determined in one focal hypercellular area, block #1. COMMENT: The lesion is a mixed glioma with an epicenter containing. areas of gemistocytic astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma, which. surround. portions of rarified white matter with sparsely infiltrating neoplasm. that have become cystic and confluent. From the epicenter, the tumor. is observed infiltrating the cerebral cortex and white matter as. individual cells with oligodendrocyte morphology and varying. cellularity. Neoplastic infiltration is reaching all margins of. resection. In the more cellular areas of tumor, there are. perivascular. lymphocytic infiltrates. In spite of the focal prominent cellularity. and. nuclear pleomorphism, mitotic figures are rare and miorovascular. cellular proliferation or areas of necrosis are absent. In this tumor, the oligodendroglioma is the predominant component, and. it is of low grade. However, the gemistocytic. component and the focal MIB-1 labelling index of 8% are worrisome, as. they probably portend aggressive behavior.",LGG,Brain Lower Grade Glioma,33.0,MALE,WHITE,,,,1915.0,1915.0,,1915.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,,,9.0,8.0

Tumor cells are diffusely and strongly positive for PTEN and MAPK. Laminin beta-1 is markedly increased while laminin beta 2 is moderately increased (see. NOTE). NOTE: A low percentage of tumor cells (20% and less) immunostaining for MGMT has been reported to be associated with a relative. response to Temodar. Hence, the less than 1% result in this case may suggest a likelihood of. being responsive to Temodar. Presence of activated (phosphorylated) p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (pMAPK) in glioblastoma multiforme has been. shown to be associated with a relative resistance to radiation therapy. Hence, a high percentage of tumor cells Immunoreactive to pMAPK antibody (although a cut-off point has not been well established. yet at the moment) in this case may suggest the possibility of a relative resistance to radiation therapy. Retained expression of PTEN was found to be associated with a more favorable prognosis in patients with high grade gliomas. Hence, retained expression of PTEN in this case may suggest the possibility of a. relatively favorable prognosis. Recent studies have shown an adverse prognostic significance of increased laminin 31 (laminin-8) and decreased laminin ß2. (laminin-9) expression predicting a worse survival of patients with high grade gliomas. al: Association between. laminin-8 and glial tumor grade, recurrence, and patient survival. ce, elevated expression of. laminin 31 and 32 in this tumor may suggest the tumor aggressiveness intermediate between the 1B1 (or normal)/1ß2 (or normal). (the most favorable prognosis) and tß1/1ß2 (the least favorable prognosis). However, the use of these tests in guiding therapy has limitations. Review of the relevant literature and clinical correlation is. advised.

TCGA-DX-A3LY,"Clinical Diagnosis & History: Specimens Submitted: 1: Right retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, right kidney and right. adrenal gland. DIAGNOSIS: 1. Soft tissue, right retroperitoneum, right kidney and right adrenal. gland, mass, resection: - High grade Spindle cell sarcoma compatible with Dedifferentiated. liposarcoma. (see Note). - The tumor measures 18.2 cm in greatest dimension. - The dedifferentiated component includes a high grade spindle cell. sarcoma. - Tumor does not involve the kidney or adrenal gland. Tumor extends close to (less than 0.1 cm) the resection margin. Note: The retroperitoneal mass shows a high grade spindle cell sarcoma. composed of spindle cells in a predominantly palisading pattern. (schwannian) Focal areas show spindle cells in a loose, partially myxoid,. background with scattered large atypical cells. Mitoses, upto 7 per 10 hpf,. are identified. The surrounding peri-renal adipose tissue shows mild atypia,. but morphologic features are insufficient for a definitive diagnosis of a. well differentiated liposarcoma. Immunohistochemical stains show that the. tumor cells are positive for CD34, CDK4 (focal) and MDM2 (focal weak) and. negative for S100, SMA, Desmin and CD117. A MIB 1 (KI67) stains shows a high. proliferation rate of 15-20%. Based on the morphology, this represents a. high grade spindle cell sarcoma compatible with a dedifferentiated. liposarcoma. The focal nature of the CDK4 and MDM2 staining is. uncharacteristic of this entity. FISH studies are being performed to confirm. this diagnostic impression. This case was also reviewed by Dr. 1, who agrees with the above. interpretation. I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF.

Gross Description. The specimen is received in 7 parts: A. The specimen is received fresh labeled ""UTERUS, TUBES, OVARIES, CERVIX"" and consists of a 195 g distorted uterus with. attached cervix and bilateral adnexa, 8.5 cm from anterior to posterior, 8 cm from fundus to ectocervix, and 7.5 cm from cornu to. cornu. The serosa is tan-pink, smooth and glistening. The ectocervical mucosa is tan-pink, smooth and glistening, 4.8 cm in diameter. which surrounds a 1 cm slitlike os. The serosa on the anterior surface is inked red and the serosa on the posterior surface is inked. black. The endocervical canal is tan, glistening striated. Within the endometrial cavity and displacing the endometrium entirely, is a 7. x 4.5 x 1.5 cm tan, friable, polypoid mass. No uninvolved endometrium is grossly identified. This mass comes to within 3.5 cm from. the anterior endo-ectocervical junction and 4 cm from the posterior endo-ectocervical junction, 1.8 cm from the anterior serosal. surface and 0.5 cm from the posterior serosal surface. Sectioning beneath this mass on the anterior aspect reveals no gross invasion. into the myometrium, but on the posterior aspect, grossly extends to within 0.5 cm of the serosa. There are also approximately 5. intramural and subserosal, tan-white, bulging, whorled, well-circumscribed nodules ranging from 0.5-5 cm in greatest dimension. No. areas of hemorrhage or necrosis are identified. The left adnexal unit consists of 4.3 x 2 x 1.5 cm ovary and a fimbriated fallopian tube, 5.8 cm in length and 0.7 cm in diameter. The. right adnexal unit consists of a 3.5 x 2 x 1 cm ovary and a fimbriated fallopian tube 5.5 cm in length and 0,7 cm in diameter. A central. portion of each fallopian tube is missing. The outer surfaces of the ovaries are tan pink and cerebriform. Sectioning reveals. unremarkable cut surfaces. The serosa of the fallopian tubes is grey purple, smooth and glistening. Sectioning reveals patent, pinpoint. lumens. Rep. sections are submitted as follows: A1-anterior cervix. Print Date/Time: Collected Date/Time: Received Date/Time: A2-posterior cervix.

COMMENT: The periductal liver tissue (part E), left partial hepatectomy (part I),. and caudate margin of liver (part J) specimens show a. moderately-differentiated adenocarcinoma with irregular glands in a. desmoplastic stroma. Mitotic activity is readily identified (up to 4. mitotic figures/HPF} including atypical mitotic figures. Overall, the. morphologic features of the carcinoma are not specific for primary site. Immunohistochemical stains for CK7, CK19, CK20, and HepParl were. evaluated on block I5 to further characterize this tumor. Tumor cells. are negative for CK20, which argues against a lower GI tract origin and. négative for HepParl, which argues against a hepatocellular carcinoma. The tumor cells show positive staining for CK7 and CK19, which is not. specific but is compatible with a cholangiocarcinóma if metastasis can. be excluded clinically. Tumor is transected at the margin of the main left liver lobe specimen. (part I) In the separately submitted ""caudate márgin"" (part J). specimen, the liver was received with blue ink on one surface of the. specimen. The remaining surgical margins on this specimen were inked. black and cauterized tumor is present at the black ink but not at the. blue ink surface. Correlation with operative findings is required in. order to determine the final margin status.

Two specimens received. 1: The first specimen is labelled ""right middle lobe"" and consists of a piece of lung measuring 123 x. 100 x 55 mm and weighing 232 g. An amount of fat and pericardium is adherent to one surface while. the pleura on the opposite side appears puckered. On sectioning a large tumour mass measuring. approximately 53 x 45 X 57 mm is seen. This is approximately 11 mm away from the bronchial. resection margin and extends through most of the specimen. The tumour has a yellow nodular surface. with a central necrotic area. The tumour is approximately 1 mm away from opposing pleural surfaces. and 2 mm away from the pleural margin opposite the bronchial resection margin. The tumour extends. to the area underlying the pericardium and fat and on sectioning appears to invade into the pericardium. and fat.

The Ki-67 immunostain shows an. increased MIB-1 labeling index within this p53-positive region. Throughout the. neoplasm, the beta-catenin stain shows a membranous immunoreactive pattern,. consistent with the absence of a WNT pathway activation.

Six specimens are received. 1: The first specimen is labelled ""R middle lobe, R lower lobe, R upper lobe"". and consists of right middle and lower lobes with a small stapled wedge of. upper lobe superiorly. The specimen measures 165 x 75 x 45 mm with the stapled. wedge of upper lobe measuring 70 x 30 x 30 mm. There is a firm mass with. overlying pleural adhesions at the apical aspect of the lower lobe, measuring. 52 x 50 x 35 mm. On sectioning, the mass has a pale sclerotic appearance and. is centrally cavitated. The cavity measures 12 mm across. The tumour extends. to apparently involve the lateral pleural surface and it extends close to the. pleura on the medial aspect. In this region it extends into a bronchus. There. is possible involvement of the upper lobe but the tumour appears well clear of. the stapled upper lobe resection margin. No other focal lesions are identified. on sectioning and there are no other endobronchial lesions.

MICROSCOPIC. 1: Sections show a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with central. cavitation. The cavitation appears to be due, at least in part, to vascular. invasion by tumour which is present at multiple sites throughout the sections. Tumour invades into overlying parietal pleura but appears clear of the soft. tissue resection margin. No lymphatic invasion is seen, and peribronchial. lymph nodes show no evidence of metastatic carcinoma. The upper lobe resection. margin is well clear of malignancy. Proximally the tumour has a protruding. endobronchial component but no in situ squamous carcinoma Is found, and the. bronchial resection margin is clear of malignancy. Focal perineural invasion. is found towards the hilum. Lung parenchyma adjacent to the tumour shows. organising pneumonia, while more distant lung parenchyma is unremarkable. 2: Sections show reactive lymphoid hyperplasia and several silicotic nodules,. but there is no evidence of metastatic carcinoma. 3: Sections show small foci of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in one of. the lymph nodes. 4-6: Sections show reactive lymphoid hyperplasia and scattered silicotic. nodules, but there is no evidence of metastatic carcinoma.

Brain, temporal lobe tumor, excision biopsy: Anaplastici. astrocytoma (WHO. Grade III) (see comment) . COMMENT. Sections show a poorly preserved gemistocytic astrocytoma. demonstrating. moderately high pleomorphism. A few scattered mitotic figures and. apoptotic. bodies are noted. Microvascular proliferation and necrosis are not. seen. A. minor oligodendroglial component may also be present. The tumor is diffusely and strongly p53 positive. The Ki-67 labeling. index is. approximately 20% Positive and negative controls show appropriate. immunoreactivity. PROCEDURES/ADDENDA. Loss of Heterozvaositv 1p, 19q Assay (LOH). Interpretation. NEGATIVE: Allelic loss on chromosome arm 1p and chromosome arm 19q is. NOT detected. Informative loci are: D1S1592, D1S552, D19S219, D19S412, and PLA2G4C. Results-Comments. Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block. DNA extracted from a corresponding blood specimen was used as normal. reference. control. H slide was examined and no microdissection was. needed. TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA. (baseline) / Tumor DNA pairs using 3 markers at both 1p and 19q. The 3. markers. on 1p are D1S548, D1S1592, and D1S552 (with D1S468, D1S1612, and. D1S496 as. backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219, D19S412, and. PLA2G4C. (with D19S606 and D19S1182 as backup) . All markers are microsatellites. (2 or 4. nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a minisatellite (26 nt repeat). polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score,. amplicon size, and ease of interpretation. The backup markers are used. if the. first line markers at that chromosome arm are uninformative or. otherwise. ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each. chromosomal arm represents the typical finding in oligodendrogliomas. with 1p. and 19q deletion.

TECHNICAL SENSITIVITY: The presence of >15% non-neoplastic cells in. the sample. may preclude the detection of allelic loss. Interpretation. POSITIVE: Methylated MGMT promoter is detected. Results-Comments. Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block. H. slide was examined and no microdissection was. needed. TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT. promoter. have been shown to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents. Assessment of. MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA. followed. by real-time PCR amplification (MethyLight) of methylated and. unmethylated DNA. sequences. The analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by. serial. dilution of methylated positive control DNA into unmethylated DNA, and. was. assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated. DNA. Factors such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the. sample, or. extensive tissue necrosis, may preclude the detection of methylated. MGMT. promoter sequences.

Diagnosis Comment: Section from posterior margin shows involvement by a moderate tumor infiltrate. ADDENDA: 1p and 19q FISH studies were performed on cells within paraffin sections from tumor. Two hybridizations were. performed: one with a 19q probe/control 19p pair and one with a 1p probe/control 1q pair. The 19q and 1p probes. mapped to the regions that are commonly deleted in gliomas. The 19q to 19p probe ratio was 1.01. The 1p to 1q. probe ratio was 0.99. For both probes, the normal ratio is approximately 1. Any ratio less than 0.80 is consistent. with deletion of the chromosomal region of interest. There was no evidence of 1p or 19q. However, approximately 45% of the cells had 3-4 copies of the 1p, 1, 19p. and 19q probes. Similar results have been observed in other glioma specimens with gain of chromosomes 1 and. 19. The results may also be consistent with tumor tetraploidy or aneuploidy. continued next page. This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by.

""Left temporal uncus"", four fragments, aggregating to 1 x 1 x 0.3. cm. Semifirm, tanish-white. In total, 14. C. ""Left parahippocampus"", one fragment, 1 X 0.7 x 0.3 cm. Tanish-. white. In total, 15. D. ""Left hippocampus"", five fragments, aggregating to 3 X 2.2 x 0.9. cm. Semifirm, tanish-white. In total, 16-19. MICROSCOPIC: A. Portions of cerebral cortex and adjacent white. matter. which are focally extensively infiltrated by a neoplastic. proliferation. of glial cells. The neoplastic cells have rather small nuclei with. moderate nuclear pleomorphism, and diffusely permeate the white matter. and cortex with prominent perineuronal satellitosis and focal subpial. accumulation. Mitotic figures are occasionally seen, however,. microvascular cellular proliferation or necrosis is absent. B. Fragments of brain tissue extensively infiltrated by a neoplasm. similar to that described for part A. The cellularity is higher and. the nuclear pleomorphism is more prominent in this specimen, and. mitotic figures are also observed. Again, microvascular cellular. proliferation and necrosis are absent. C. Portions of brain tissue extensively infiltrated by a neoplasm. similar to that described for part A. D. Portions of hippocampus which are focally infiltrated by a. neoplasia similar to that described for part B, which is effacing the. dentate gyrus and pyramidal cell layer. SPECIAL STAINS: MIB-1 and factor VIII AA immunoperoxidase methods. were. preformed on blocks 5 and 14. With the MIB-1, a labelling index of about 15% was determined on. section 14 in areas of solid tumor. With the FVIII AA, no endothelial. microvascular proliferation was demonstrated. COMMENT: In all the four specimens, there is extensive infiltration. of. the gray and white matter by a fibrillary astrocytoma. The tumor. effaces the normal cortical architecture with the presence of. prominent. satellitosis and focal subpial accumulation. The neurons present. throughout the specimens are considered to be native entrapped. neurons,. not part of the neoplasm. The tumor is moderately cellular with. moderate nuclear pleomorphism, and is not difficult to find mitotic. figures. However, microvascular cellular proliferation and necrosis. are absent. The cellularity, degree of nuclear atypia and presence of. mitoses with a high MIB-1 labelling index of 15%, justify a diagnosis. of anaplastic astrocytoma. The absence of endothelial proliferation,. however, probably places this neoplasm at the low end of the spectrum. of anaplastic astrocytomas.

GROSS DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received fresh, in two parts, each labeled with the patient's. name, unit number. Part A, labeled ""#1. Right hemicolectomy"", consists of a right hemicolectomy,. including a portion of terminal ileum (7.0 cm in length), a segment of right. colon and cecum (22.0 cm in length), and an appendix (6.0 cm in length, 0.4 cm. in. diameter) and attached pericolic adipose tissue (including a portion of. adipose tissue consistent with omentum, measuring 30.0 x 16.0 x 1.2 cm) The. proximal stapled resection margin measures 3.0 cm and is inked blue, and the. distal stapled resection margin measures 4.0 cm and is inked black. The serosa. is pink and focally firm at the cecum and proximal portion of right colon (11.0. x 9.0 cm), 7.0 cm from the proximal stapled resection margin and 10.0 cm from. the distal stapled resection margin. The specimen is opened to reveal an. exophytic focally ulcerating irregular tan-yellow to pink mass (15.0 x 10.0. x. 4. cm). The mass involves the adjacent ileocecal valve, and comes to 7.5 cm. from the proximal stapled resection margin, and 10.0 cm from the distal stapled. resection margin. Per the surgeon, there is an ""adhesed peritoneal folding. area (8.0 x 8.0 cm)"", within the previously described firm serosal area,. designated as ""true resection margin"" (inked black) On cut section, the mass. extends into the underlying colonic wall, and into the surrounding pericolic. adipose tissue, coming to less than 0.1 cm from the black ink peritonealized. margin, as designated per the surgeon, and is 2.0 cm from the closest radial. mesenteric margin. Representative sections of the mass are submitted to the GI. stem cell lab for special studies, and additional representative sections of. the mass and uninvolved colonic mucosa are submitted to tissue bank for special. studies. The remaining mucosa is tan with normal folds, with no additional. discrete masses or lesions identified. Multiple tan-pink rubbery lymph nodes. are identified within the surrounding pericolonic adipose tissue, ranging from. 0.2 cm to 1. cm in greatest dimension. Gross photos are taken.

Uterus, cervix, left fallopian tube and ovary, hysterectomy, salpingo-oophorectomy: Endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium, invading the myometrium 30 mm out. of. a total myometrial thickness of 65 mm (less than 50% myometrial invasion). Uterine serosa with focal endometriosis. Uterine leiomyomata. Cervix with invasion of cervical stromal connective tissue by endometrioid. adenocarcinoma. Resection margins are negative. Left ovary with endometriotic cysts; negative for carcinoma. Left fallopian tube with hydrosalpinx; negative for carcinoma. C. Omentum, omentectomy: Fibroadipose tissue negative for carcinoma. D. Para-aortic lymph nodes, regional resection: Two lymph nodes negative for carcinoma (0/2). E. Right obturator nodes, regional resection: Two lymph nodes negative for carcinoma (0/2). F. Left iliac node, excisional biopsy: One lymph node negative for carcinoma. COMMENT: Given the presence of tumor in both the endometrium and ovary, it is not clear if. synchronous primaries are present. versus an endometrial primary. If synchronous tumors are clinically favored, then the. ovarian tumor is staged as. pT1cNOMO and the uterine tumor is staged as T2NOMO. However, if an endometrial. primary is clinically favored,. then the tumor is staged as T3aNOMO based on the presence of ovarian involvement.

""Uterus, cervix, tubes, ovaries and fibroid (AF1-4)"", received fresh and. placed in formalin at is a 303 gram, 13 x 10 x 4.5 cm. didelphic uterus with attached bilateral tubes and ovaries (bilateral ovaries-. 2.5 x 1.7 x 1.4 cm, bilateral fimbriated fallopian tube- 6 cm long x 0.6 cm in. diameter) The 3 cm in diameter cervix has one 1.5 cm in diameter patent os. which leads into a septated endocervical canal, dividing the endocervical. canal and endometrial cavities into right and left separate structures. The. 7. x 4 cm left endometrial cavity is 100$ effaced and replaced by white-tan,. exophytic, soft and friable endometrial tumor (present on both anterior and. posterior endometrium), which grossly invades 1.5 cm into and up to 3.5 cm. thick myometrium. The tumor also extends to involve the left anterior and. posterior lower uterine segment, 3.8 and 2.9 cm from the external os,. respectively. The 7 x 1.4 cm right endometrial cavity is compressed and. distorted by the aforementioned tumor in the left endometrial cavity as well. as by a large intramural nodule underlying the left endometrial cavity. The. right endometrium is 0.1 cm thick and contains two small, superficial tan. polyps, each 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.7 cm. These polyps are within the posterior right. endometrium. There are three total myometrial nodules ranging from 1.5 cm in greatest. dimension- 4 x 3.5 x 3 cm. All three nodules are intramural without. hemorrhage or necrosis, with the two smallest within the anterior, right. myometrium and the largest within the posterior, left myometrium. The bilateral ovaries are pink-yellow with a 0.4 cm in diameter simple. cortical cyst within the left ovary with smooth inner walls. The bilateral. fallopian tubes are also unremarkable. Also received is a separate 92 gram (fixed weight), 7.6 x 5.5 x 5.4 cm. white-tan, smooth nodule which on sectioning is focally calcified with an. otherwise whorled cut surface without hemorrhage or necrosis.

In the meantime, molecular genetic analysis of tumour DNA. extracted from the fresh uveal melanoma tissue was performed. using the technique termed multiplex ligation-dependent. probe amplification (MLPA) These investigations were. performed in the. The kit P027 from. which examines for gains or. losses in 31 loci on chromosomes 1, 3, 6 and 8, was used. The DNA concentration was measured using. and the. quality assessed using multiplex-PCR prior to the MLPA. reaction. The DNA concentration was high and of good quality on. assessment. The MLPA reaction was run at least twice on. differing occasions, resulting in similar results. The results of the sequence analysis of the MLPA products is. printed on a separate report. In summary, sequence analysis. demonstrated: loss of chromosome 1p,. monosomy 3,. partial losses of chromosome 6. and gains in chromosome 8q.

A result of a deleted 1p and 19q suggests a favorable prognosis. A solitary 1p. deletion suggests an intermediate prognosis. A 19q solitary deletion may suggest a. favorable prognosis in a smaller subset of tumors. The lack of either 1p and/or. 19q deletion (s) is considered a poor prognostic indicator and may be associated. with decreased disease-free survival and overall survival.

The. results of this assay are reported below: MGMT Methylation Assay: Result: Gene Methylation detected. Methylation Score: 27.13. -REFERENCE VALUE--. unmethylated <2.00. methylated >=2.00. Background: MGMT [0 (6) -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase] is a DNA repair enzyme that is. involved in the repair of damage caused by a variety of DNA crosslinking compounds,. including alkylating agents. Increased methylation of the MGMT gene promotor. region causes diminished or silenced expression of the gene, making cells more. sensitive to DNA damage. This relationship has been shown for glioblastomas and. alkylating agents such as temozolomide. Approximately 40-50% of glioblastomas. exhibit MGMT gene methylation. Retrospective studies have shown that detection of. MGMT promotor methylation in tumor samples is associated with an increased. likelihood of a favorable response to temozolomide. Methodology: DNA is isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens. Molecular analysis of the MGMT gene is performed by methylation-specific PCR and. detected on. The MGMT and beta-Actin copy numbers are used to calculate. the ratio of MGMT/beta-Actin x 1000. Molecular-base testing is highly accurate,. but as in any laboratory test, rare diagnostic errors may occur. Results of this. test are for Investigational Purposes Only. The performance characteristics of. this assay have been determined by. The result should not be used as. a. diagnostic procedure without confirmation of the diagnosis by another medically. established diagnostic product or procedure.

A: The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin. The. container is designated ""lymph node no 8"" and contains a 2.5 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm firm tan. yellow ovoid portion of tissue grossly consistent with a lymph node. On sectioning,. the. lymph node is firm, white, and grossly suspicious. The trisected lymph node is submitted. entirely in A1 and A2. B: The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin. The. container is designated ""portal lymph nodes"" and contains an irregular heavily. cauterized, 0.9 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm greyish tan tissue fragment. The fragment is bisected and. submitted in toto in B1. C: The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin. The. container is designated ""gallbladder"" and contains an intact unopened 6.5 x 3.5 x 2.0 cm. gallbladder. The gallbladder serosa is smooth and shiny without nodules or adhesions,. and the adventitial surface is slightly roughened. The cystic duct is open. The cystic. duct margin is inked black. A 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm plump ovoid cystic duct lymph node is. present. The gallbladder lumen contains viscous green bile and no gallstones. The. gallbladder wall is thin, pliable, and approximately 2 mm thick. The gallbladder mucosa. is green and velvety with marked yellow speckling suggestive of cholesterolosis. There. are no polyps, masses or other lesions. Representative sections are submitted as. follows: C1. bisected cystic duct lymph node and black - inked cystic duct margin. C2. two representative sections of gallbladder mucosa, one from near gallbladder. neck and. one from fundus. D: The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin. The. container is designated ""Whipple's specimen"" and contains a 23 cm long portion of. duodenum with attached 6.5 x 5.5 x 3.5 cm portion of the pancreatic head. The duodenum. has an average linear circumference of 4 cm, and the distal 13 cm of the duodenum shows. dusky ischemic discoloration. The duodenal mucosa has the normal pattern of folds,. without polyps or other lesions. The retroperitoneal margin (designated with a blue. suture) is inked blue and the SMA groove is inked green, and the pancreatic neck margin. is. inked black. A portion of the pancreatic duct is identified at the pancreatic neck. margin, but the duct appears occluded less than 1 cm from the margin. Replacing much of. the head of the pancreas, there is an ill-defined roughly 3.7 x 3.5 x 3.5 cm firm rubbery. tan white mass with infiltrative borders. On sectioning, the central portion of the mass. contains numerous cystic spaces filled with thin clear mucin. Grossly, the mass abuts. the retroperitoneal margin and the SMA groove but does not clearly involve those margins. The mass closely abuts the common bile duct, which contains a metal stent. The mass also. approaches to the level of the ampulla, but does not invade the wall of the duodenum. Numerous lymph nodes are identified in the surrounding peripancreatic fat, a few of which. are slightly enlarged and firm. Representative sections are submitted as follows: D1. proximal duodenal margin. D2. distal duodenal margin. D3. bile duct margin. D4. tumor with pancreatic neck margin. D5-7. three contiguous sections of tumor showing relationship of tumor with common. bile duct. and retroperitoneal margin.

E: The specimen consists of pink tan tissue measuring 2.2 x 1 x 0.3 cm. Submitted in. toto in E1. The specimen is received fresh for intraoperative consultation in a container designated. ""pancreas neck"". The previously frozen tissue is entirely resubmitted for permanent. sections in EQS1. Frozen Section Diagnosis. E: Pancreatic Neck: Chronic inflammation with some dilated ducts. No malignancy in the sampled. sections. Pathologist Comment. E. Permanent sections of the pancreatic neck margin (i.e. slide E1-2) reveal rare. crushed atypical cells, present in pools of mucin surrounding a nerve, highly suspicious. for adenocarcinoma. These cells are not definitively identified in the original frozen. section slides. Since the frozen section represents the ""true"" margin, and the permanent. sections are cut from deeper (more distal) tissue, it is estimated that the true. pancreatic neck margin is negative but that tumor extends very close (likely 1-2 mm) to. this margin.

The galibladder's contents consist of a moderate amount of dark green, viscous bile. The mucosa. of. the gallbladder is elevated and grossly unremarkable. The cystic duct is patent to the flow of bile and. has a 0.3 cm in diameter fumen. No lymph nodes are grossly identified attached to the gallbladder. neck. The gallbladder's wall is mildly edematous, averaging 0.3 cm in thickness, No tissue was. submitted to the Tissue Procurement Laboratory. Representative sections of the specimen are. submitted in 2 cassettes, A1 and A2. B. Specimen B is labeled ""hepatic artery node"". The specimen consists of a single, roughly. ovoid, rubbery potential lymph node measuring up to 1.4 cm in greatest dimension. No tissue was. submitted to the Tissue Procurement Laboratory. The lymph node is serially sectioned and is. submitted entirely in 2 cassettes, B1 and 82. C. Specimen C is labeled biliary stent, gross only. The specimen consists of a blue plastic tube. which measures 13.0 cm in length and 0.2 cm in diameter. The ends of the tube reveal a patent. lumen which measures up to 0,2 cm in diameter. No sticky material is identified on the surface of the. tube. The specimen is received for gross analysis only. D. Specimen D is labeled ""Whipple, frozen section on retroperitoneal margin, pancreatic margin,. bile duct"", The specimen consists of a pancreatic head (7 x x 2.5 cm) with attached duodenum. (16.0 cm in length and up to 4.5 cm in circumference at the level of distal resection margin) and distal. portion of stomach (4.5 cm in length and up to 10.0 cm in circumference at the level of stapled gastric. resection margin). The serosa of the stomach is pink-tan, smooth and glistening, while the outer. surface of the duodenum is shaggy with a small amount of fibroadipose tissue attached. There is. also. a small amount of omental adipose tissue attached to the gastric wall. The peripheral aspects of the. pancreatic head are composed of a small amount of adipose tissue which is ranging from 0.1 to 0.3. cm in thickness. Prior to sectioning, the specimen is inked as follows: Anterior aspect of the pancreatic head: Green. Medial aspect (groove): Red. Stapled retroperitoneal margin: Orange. The remainder of the posterior aspect of the pancreatic head: Black. Parenchymal resection margin: Black. Common bile duct margin: Blue. On opening. the duodenum reveais an irregular, ill defined, sessile, focal hemormagic tumor (1.5 x 1. cm) which involves ampulla of Vater On sectioning, the tumor measures up to 0,5 cm in depth and. appears to involve adjacent portion of pancreatic head.

This staging information is based on information available at. the time of this report, and is subject to change pending. clinical review and additional information. Comment: Immunohistochemical stains are performed on block B4, a. representative section of the mesenteric mass, and demonstrate. the mass is negative for pancytokeratin, CD117, S100, and muscle. specific actin with slight focal staining for desmin and. blood vessels outlined by CD34. Note is made of the patient's. prior pathology and the pathology referral to. and Dr. opinion. The current specimen demonstrates prominent vasculature. and focal fascicular architecture, consistent with mesenteric. fibromatosis. Dr. notes in his comments on the prior pathology. that a subset of fibromatoses can be beta catenin negative. (which was the case with the patient's prior pathology) Given. the overall appearance of the tumor and immunohistochemical. profile, we favor mesenteric fibromatosis. Dr. has reviewed select slides from specimen B along with the. immunohistochemical stains and concurs with the diagnosis of. mesenteric fibromatosis. Immunohistochemical stains are performed on block D1 and. demonstrate the renal tumor is positive for CD117, patchily. positive for CD10 and negative for racemase, RCC, and vimentin,. consistent with the chromophobe variant of renal cell carcinoma.

TCGA-QF-A5YS,"-OF-ASYS-01A-PR. ADDENDUM. Addendum Comment. Section, designated B4, of the left obturator lymph node shows a nodular. architecture with several follicles some of which have small germinal. centers. Occasional follicles composed predominantly or entirely of small. lymphocytes some of which have a monocytoid appearance. Scattered, rare. plasma cells are noted. Areas of fatty infiltration are also identified. Increased numbers of histiocytes are seen in the dilated sinuses. An. immunohistochemical panel was performed to further characterize the. lymphocytes with respect to architecture. B and T cells (CD20 and CD3. positive, respectively) show appropriate zonation. The T cells are also. positive for CD5 and CD43. No co-expression of CD20 and CD43 or CD5 is. appreciated. The small germinal centers are positive for CD20, CD10 and. bcl-6, but negative for bcl-2. Some of the small follicles are positive for. CD20 and bcl-2, but negative for CD10 and bcl-6, these follicles most likely. represent either mantle/marginal zone hyperplasia or primary follicles. CD21. and CD23 stains highlight the follicular dendritic meshwork in the. follicles. Cyclin D1 is positive in the endothelial cells, but negative in. the lymphocytes. The combined morphologic and immunophenotypic features in this lymph node. are most consistent with a reactive process. Clinical correlation and. follow-up is recommended.

All tissue submitted has been processed and examined. Examination of. permanent sections confirms the intraoperative diagnosis of high grade glioma. The parenchyma is extensively effaced by a malignant glioma containing small. areas of necrosis. The neoplastic cells possess variably pleomorphic and. hyperchromatic nuclei with coarse chromatin and small nucleoli and perinuclear. cytoplasmic clearing. In many areas these cells lie in a background that. contains frequent interconnecting small thin walled blood vessels as well as. occasional calcium deposits. Occasional multinucleate tumour qiant cells are. present. Throughout the tumour there are frequent mitotic figures and apoptotic. bodies. There is widespread endothelial proliferation. There is quite extensive. immunohistochemical positivity for GFAP, whilst scattered cells stain positively. for p53. The GFAP positivity highlights some mini-gemistocytes. The. proliferation index, as measured by MIB-1 (Ki67), is variable, and approximates. to 10-15%. The differential diagnosis rests obvious high grade glioma rests. between an anaplastic oligodendroglioma (WHO Grade III) and a high grade mixed. ligoastrocytoma, which, on the basis of the presence of necrosis, would be WHO.

B. Received fresh labeled with the patient's name and ""splenic flexure colon lesion"" with. tissue bank coordinator in attendance is a 12 cm segmental resection of large bowel which. measures 4 cm in diameter. requests gross evaluation for margins. Both the. surgical margins are stapled and not clinically designated. Tattoo pigment is noted which. abuts one staple line. The adipose tissue is wrapped around the serosa in the mid portion. Blue ink is applied to this area. The tattoo stapled margin measures 5 cm in length and. opposite margin measures 3.5 cm in length. The mesenteric margin measures 3 cm. Blue ink. is applied to this margin. In trying to separate the mesentery from the bowel, it is. found. to be adherent to the bowel surface. There is some fatty tissue present on the opposite. side which may be inclusive of some omental type tissue. The margins are removed and the. lumen probed revealing an obstructing mass present. The tumor measures 6 cm in length, it. involves the entire circumference of the bowel wall. It lies 2.5 cm from the tattooed. margin and 2 cm from the opposite margin. A portion of the edge of the tumor and. non-neoplastic mucosa is provided to the tissue bank coordinator. The specimen is pinned. out onto a corkboard for several hours of formalin fixation. The partial fixed specimen is. serially sectioned revealing that the tumor extends deep into the muscle wall. possibly. extending through the muscle wall. A subjacent lymph node is identified measuring 1 cm. The pericolic/mesenteric adipose tissue was placed in a 50/50 solution of lymph node. revealing solution and formalin. On cross section, several lymph nodes are identified. which range from 0.4 to 1 cm in greatest dimension each. No omental nodules are. identified. Cassette Summary: B1.2 -. tattoo pigment.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: A&C. These biopsies of the left lobe of the liver show focal granulomatous inflammation. with fibrosis. The granulomas are mostly noncaseating, composed of epithelioid. histiocytes, multinucleated giant cells and a sprinkling of small lymphocytes These. granulomas are set in a fibrous stroma. À fow of the granulomas have scant central. necrosis but most are noncaseating. AFB and GMS stains are obtained on both biopsies. No. organisms are seen. D. This is a piece of adipose tissue containing a sclerotic, partially calcified nodule. compatible with fat necrosis. There is no evidence of metastatic carcinoma. B.

TCGA-3B-A9HJ,"Final Diagnosis. A. GROIN MASS, LEFT, BIOPSY: Dedifferentiated liposarcoma (well differentiated and low grade spindle cell sarcoma. with prominent myxoid and inflammatory change). Foci of small lymphocytic lymphoma associated with the spindle cell sarcoma. Tumor size: overall 11.6 x 10.5 X 6.5 cm with circumscribed 7.7 x 6.7 x 5.8 cm area of. Non-lipogenic sarcoma. Tumor necrosis: None. Mitotic activity: No mitoses seen (less than 1% proliferative index on Ki-67). Other findings: Benign lymph node (1),. See Comment. COMMENT: The groin mass is composed of soft tissue and hematologic malignancies. The soft. tissue tumor is a dedifferentiated liposarcoma which is composed predominantly of a non-lipogenic. spindle cell sarcoma surrounded by well differentiated lipsarcoma, adipocytic and focal sclerosing. variants. The spindle cell sarcoma appears to be predominantly low grade with scattered moderately. to rarely markedly atypical spindled and epithelioid nuclei in foci off background of myxoid stromal. change. Inflammatory cells (predominantly plasma cells with a few scattered eosinophils and. lymphocytes) are intermixed with the tumor. These areas are separate from the associated. hematopoietic component. Immunohistochemical stains on the spindle cell sarcoma show tumor cells. to be diffusely positive for vimentin and CD68, and negative for actin, desmin and CD43. Ki-67. reveals low proliferative activity with less than 1% of nuclei staining (manual estimate). Multiple foci of. lymphoid aggregates with and without germinal centers are present associated only with the spindle. cell sarcoma. Some of these aggregates are composed of a monotonous population of small. lymphoid cells with clumped chromatin and scant cytoplasm. Immunohistochemical stains highlight. these small cells showing them to be B-cells (CD20+, CD79a+) with coexpresion of weak CD5 and. CD23 (partial). BCL-1 is negative, excluding mantle cell lymphoma. CD3 is positive in T-cells. ISH. with kappa and lambda probes demonstrate polyclonal plasma cells. The overall findings of this. component are consistent with small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). This correlates with the. concurrent flow cytometric and FISH CLL panel results (. The hematopoietic workup and. diagnosis was performed in association with Dr. (Hematopathologist). the attending pathologist, personally reviewed all slides. and / or materials and rendered the final diagnosis.

Labeled with the patient's name, designated ""uterus, cervix and. bilateral tubes"", received fresh in the Operating Room for gross. consultation, and subsequently fixed in formalin, is a 140 gram. total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy specimen. The uterus was previously incised on both sides at the time of. intraoperative consultation. The uterus is slightly distorted in. shape. The uterus is about 8.5 cm from the fundus to the. ectocervix, 5.5 cm from cornu to cornu, and up to 4.2 cm from the. anterior surface to the posterior surface. The uterine serosa is. red-tan and smooth. The cervix is about 3.0 cm in long and up to. 3.6 cm in maximum diameter in the ectocervical region. Attached to. the ectocervix, there is a short (less than 0.3 cm long) cuff of. grossly unremarkable pink-tan vaginal mucosa. The mucosa lining the. ectocervix is tan-pink, focally wrinkled, but otherwise smooth. The. external cervical os is patent and about 0.3 cm in diameter. The. cervical transformation zone is distinct. The endocervical canal is. about 2.5 cm long. Within the endocervical canal, there is. relatively abundant mucoid material that is blood-tinged. The. endocervical mucosa is tan and rugose. Cut sections of the cervix. reveal several tiny to small nucus-filled cysts, ranging from about. 0. 1 to 0.3 cm in diameter. The cervix appears grossly free of. tumor. The endometrial cavity is about 5.5 cm long and up to 3.2 cm. in width. Within the posterior uterus, there is a large friable,. polypoid to papillated tan-red tumor mass that extends from the. posterior fundus to the posterior lower uterine segment. The tumor. measures about 5.5 x 3.0 cm in surface area. The surface of the. tumor is focally hemorrhagic and focally necrotic. Cut sections. reveal a maximum tumor thickness of about 0.8 cm. Cut sections of. the posterior uterus reveal superficial myometrial invasion involving. less than 20% of the uterine wall thickness.

No endometrial tumor is seen in the anterior uterus. Cut. sections of the uterus also reveal six circumscribed leiomyomas, one. of which is submucosal, two of which are subserosal, and the. remainder of which are intramural. The leiomyomas are each well. circumscribed and range from about 0.2 to 1.5 cm in maximum. dimensions. Each of the leiomyomas is composed of firm solid tan-. white whorled tissue with grossly evident areas of hemorrhage or. necrosis. The muscular uterine wall has a maximum thickness of about. 2.0 cm. The uninvolved myometrium is tan and firm. The left. fallopian tube has fimbria at one end, is 5.4 cm long, up to 0.5 cm. in diameter, has a smooth, pink-tan serosal surface, a pinpoint. patent lumen, and appears grossly free of tumor. The left ovary is. atrophic, about 1. x 1.5 x 0.7 cm and has a cerebriform, tan-yellow. serosal surface with a few tiny adhesions. Cut surfaces of the left. ovary reveal a peripheral rim of yellow-t cortical stroma and. multiple corpora albicantia, but no gross evidence of tumor. The. white fallopian tube has fimbria at one end, is about 5.2 cm long,. up. to 0.4 cm in diameter, has a smooth, tan-pink serosal surface, and a. pinpoint patent lumen. The right fallopian tube appears grossly free. of tumor. The right ovary is atrophic, about 2.0 x 1.3 x 0.9 cm, and. has a cerebriform to undulated, yellow-tan serosal surface with. multiple adhesions. Cut surfaces of the right ovary reveal a. peripheral rim of yellow-tan cortical stroma, several minute to tiny. cystic spaces, several corpora albicantia, and no gross evidence of. tumor.

The non-neoplastic liver, seen best in blocks 1. 3 and 10, shows no. evidence of cirrhosis. Tumor is present in blocks 1-5 and 7-12. Sections of the tumor demonstrate hepatocellular carcinoma with. variable features. There are areas with solid and trabecular growth,. typical of hepatocellular carcinoma, and some areas with desmoplastic. stroma and a suggestion of glandular growth. Some areas are well. differentiated (grade 2) while others are moderately (grade 3) and. poorly differentiated (grade 4) with anaplastic giant cells and. numerous mitotic figures. Some areas have tumor cells with cytoplasmic. fat, and some areas have hyaline globules. The surgical margins are. negative. but the satellite nodule noted grossly (block 3) is within 1. mm of the inked margin. The immunostain results support the diagnosis. of hepatocellular carcinoma.

This tumor is a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. with quite extensive invasion. It extends through. the. bowel wall and sends tongues of tumor into pericolonic fat and. incites a scirrhous reaction. Because of the propensity to send. these narrow tongues of infiltrating tumor out into the fat, there. is minimal extension to the radial margin. Also tumor nests are. present within soft tissue (blocks 11, 13) . Lymphatic invasion is. noted in the pericolonic soft tissue (block number 11) . Invasion. of. an artery is also noted. Please see the template below. Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma. Histologic grade: Moderately differentiated. Primary tumor (pT) : pT3. Proximal margin: Negative for tumor. Distal margin: Tumor for tumor. Circumferential (radial) margin: Minimally positive. Distance of tumor from closest margin: Tumor is present to within. 1.5 cm. of the distal margin and is present at the radial margin. Vascular invasion: Rare lymphatic and arterial invasion noted. Regional lymph nodes (pN): 52 lymph nodes present, 2 of which are. positive for metastatic disease, 2/52, pN1b. Non-lymph node pericolonic tumor: present.

TCGA-DB-5280,"r. 1 Diagnosis: Brain, right frontal lobe, excision: Grade 2 (of 4) oligoastrocytoma, astrocytic predominant (WHO, grade II). See. comment. Comment: The presence of areas of high cellularity and the cellular pleomorphism are worrisome features for early. anaplastic transformation, however, proliferative activity is still low (mitotic index up to 2-3 mitoses per 10 HPF). No endothelial vascular changes or necrosis are seen. Immunohistochemical stains were performed on paraffin embedded tissue using antibodies to GFAP, p53 and. MIB-1. GFAP is focally positive in tumor cells. p53 protein is positive in tumor cells. MIB-1 labeling varies from. low to moderate (up to 4-6%). The findings support the above diagnosis. FISH studies for 1p19q deletion will be performed and reported as an addendum. ADDENDA: 1p and 19q FISH studies were performed on cells within paraffin sections from tumor. Two hybridizations were. performed: one with a 19q probe/control 19p pair and one with a 1p probe/control lq pair. The 19q and 1p probes. mapped to the regions that are commonly deleted in gliomas. The 19q to 19p probe ratio was 0.98. The 1p to 1q. probe ratio was 0.98. For both probes, the normal ratio is approximately 1. Any ratio less than 0.80 is consistent. with deletion of the chromosomal region of interest. continued next page. There was no evidence of deletion of 1p or 19q. The results are consistent with a tetraploid tumor karyotype or. additional copies of chromosomes 1 and 19. Similar results have been observed in other glioma specimens. This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by Laboratory Medicine and Pathology,. has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and is to. 1. sed as an adjunct to existing clinical and pathological information. This test does not rule out other. chromosome anomalies. Preliminary Frozen Section Consultation: Brain, right frontal lobe, excision: Glioma. Hold for grading.

Interpretation. NEGATIVE - No evidence of EGFRvIII mutation is detected. Results-Comments. TEST DESCRIPTION: Testing performed on RNA extracted from paraffin tissue block. H and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an attractive molecular target in glioblastoma because it. is amplified,. overexpressed, and/or mutated in up to 40% to 50% of patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant. III. (EGFRvIII) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR that is commonly expressed in. glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of glioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvIII as defining prognostically. distinct. subgroups of glioblastomas. Additionally, the presence of EGFRvIII has been shown to sensitize tumors. to EGFR. tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the tumor suppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from. formalin fixed,. paraffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to cDNA. The cDNA is then amplified using. standard PCR. technique for DNA templates. PCR products are detected by gel electrophoresis. The limit of detection of. this assay. has been determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal cells. FDA Comment: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand alone diagnostic test. This test. was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the. as required. by CLIA '88 regulations. It has not been cleared or approved for specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug.

DNA extracted from a. corresponding blood specimen was used as a normal reference control. H and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed. TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA (baseline)/ Tumor DNA. pairs using 3. markers at both 1p and 19q. The 3 markers on 1p are D1S548, D1S1592, and D1S552 (with D1S468,. D1S1612, and. D1S496 as backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219, D19S412, and PLA2G4C (with. D19S606 and. D19S1182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites (2 or 4 nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a. minisatellite (26. nt repeat) polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, amplicon size, and. ease of. interpretation. The backup markers are used if the first line markers at that chromosome arm are. uninformative or. otherwise ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each chromosomal arm. represents the. typical finding in oligodendrogliomas with 1p and 19q deletion. FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand-alone diagnostic. test. This test. was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the. as required. by CLIA 88 regulations. It has not been cleared or approved for specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug. Administration (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These. results are. provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted only in the context of established. procedures. and/or diagnostic criteria. TECHNICAL SENSITIVITY: The presence of >15% non-neoplastic cells in the sample may preclude the. detection of. allelic loss. Senior Staff Pathologist. MGMT Promoter Methylation. Interpretation. NEGATIVE: No evidence of methylated MGMT promoter is detected. Results-Comments. Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block. H and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed. TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter have been shown to. benefit. from therapy with alkylating agents. Assessment of MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite. treatment of. DNA followed by real-time PCR amplification. of methylated and unmethylated DNA. sequences. The. analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial dilution of methylated positive control DNA into. unmethylated DNA, and was assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated. DNA. Factors. such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the sample, or extensive tissue necrosis, may. preclude the. detection of methylated MGMT promoter sequences.

X. 1.5 X 1 cm. piece of light tan to yellow to brown tissue consistent. with brain tissue. Most of the surface is smooth, but lobulated while. another surface is flat and smooth and possibly represents the wall of. a cyst or possibly a ventricle. All submitted in cassettes 1-3. B. Received fresh labeled ""2"", are four pieces of pink-red to maroon. soft tissue ranging in size from 1 X 1 X 0.5 cm. to 0.5 x 0.5 X 0.4. cm. A portion of the tissue is used for smear preparation and frozen. section and submitted in cassette 4FS. The remaining tissue is. submitted in cassettes 5 and 6, another small portion is submitted for. potential electron microscopy. INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION, Frozen section diagnosis: Smear. preparation and frozen section I Round cell tumor, more likely glioma. Lymphoma cannot be ruled out. C. Received fresh labeled ""occipital tumor"", are several irregular. fragmented pieces of variegated tan to tan-yellow to pink and. hemorrhagic and probably necrotic tissue ranging in size from 5.5 x. 2.5. X 1.5 cm. to 1.1 X 1.1 X 0.7 cm. Representative sections submitted in. cassettes 7-10. MICROSCOPIC: A and B. Both specimens reveal an aplastic proliferation of. oligodendrocytes with different degrees of cellularity and cytological. atypia. In some areas, the tumor is well differentiated and the. neoplastic cells display well defined cell borders and typical peri-. nuclear halos. In these areas, the cellularity is low and there is no. significant mitotic activity. However, most of the tumor consists of. areas of higher cellularity, with more pronounced nuclear pleomorphism. and readily identified mitotic figures. The stromal vessels in these. areas display endothelial hyperplasia. Except for one area present in. the frozen section control slide, there are no extensive foci of. necrosis. The tumor infiltrates the cortex in many areas and reveals. neoplastic satellitosis around non-neoplastic cortical neurons. There. is also evidence of previous hemorrhage within the tumor and numerous. interstitial calcifications are also present. In some areas, the. tumor. completely replaces the entire gyri and produces subpial aggregates on. adjacent gyri. In summary, the findings are those of an anaplastic oligodendroglioma. The grade in the tumor is anaplastic as based on the high degree of. cellularity, nuclear pleomorphism and mitotic activity in several. areas. of the tumor. In the Smith Grading System for oligodendrogliomas. these areas of anaplasia would received a Grade C-D. Immunoperoxidase. stain for monoclonal antibody MID-1 is pending and will be reported. separately. ADDENDUM REPORT.

Cell culture and in vivo models of. glioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvIII as defining prognostically distinct. subgroups of glioblastomas. Additionally, the presence of EGFRvIII has been. shown to sensitize tumors to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the tumor. suppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from formalin fixed,. paraffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to cDNA. The cDNA is. then amplified using standard PCR technique for DNA templates. PCR products. are detected by gel electrophoresis. The limit of detection of this assay has. been determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal cells. FDA Comment: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a. stand alone diagnostic test. This test was developed and its performance. characteristics determined by the. laboratory as. required by CLIA. regulations. It has not been cleared or approved for. specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) The FDA has. determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These results are. provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted only in. the context of established procedures and/or diagnostic criteria. INTRA-OPERATIVE CONSULTATION. A.

The test for progesterone receptors is negative. There is no nuclear staining in tumor. cells. Result of Her-2/neu test: This ovarian carcinoma is negative for Her-2/neu. oncoprotein over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed on block A8 using the CB11 monoclonal antibody to Her-. 2/neu oncoprotein. The. staining intensity of this carcinoma was 0 on a scale of 0-3 with focal cytoplasmic staining only (Her-2 test. interpreted. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 0 or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of Her-. 2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered borderline. We and others have observed that. many carcinomas with staining. intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are. therefore submitted for. FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of Her-2/neu. oncoprotein.

COMMENT: Part 3: The histopathological changes of the non-neoplastic liver are most. consistent with an active steatohepatitis, although other causes of liver. injury should be clinically and serologically excluded. Steatohepatitis is a non-specific pattern of injury seen most commonly with. morbid obesity, diabetes, insulin resistance, and alcohol abuse. However, it. can also be associated with nutritional causes, such as protein-calorie. malnutrition, starvation, rapid weight loss, and various intestinal bypass or. gastric stapling surgeries. Hepatic steatosis and steatohepatitis can also be the result of medications,. including amiodarone, perhexiline maleate, glucocorticoids, synthetic. estrogens, calcium channel blockers, tamoxifen, nethotrexate, valproic acid,. cocaine, and anti-viral agents (Zidovudine, Didanosine, and Fialuridine). Metabolic disorders can also cause steatosis and steatohepatitie: hyperlipidemia, Wilson'e disease, adult onset citrullinemia (type II). lipodyst rophy tysbetalipoproteinemia, Weber-Christian-Disease, Wolman's. Disease, Cholesterol ester storage disease, and fatty liver of pregnancy. Other causes include inflammatory bowel disease, intestinal bacterial. overgrowth, and exposure to environmental toxins, including phosphorous,. petrochemicals, toxic mushrooms, and organic solvents.

Received fresh in a container labeled ""right upper. lobe"" is a 296 gm, 17.8 x 11.8 x 4 cm, lung lobe compatible. with right upper lobe. In the hilar region there is an 0.8 cm long. and 1.5 cm in diameter bronchial stump which is grossly. unremarkable. The vessels at the margin are also grossly. unremarkable. There are some tan-gray lymph nodes up to 1.2 cm in. greatest dimension in the hilar region. The pleural surface is. pink-purple with some anthracotic pigment deposition. There is some. retraction of the pleural surface. The specimen is sectioned, and. there is a 2.6 x 2 x 1.8 Cm rubbery tan-white mass underlying the. area with pleural retraction, with the mass suggestive of invading. the pleura. Approximately 2 cm from this mass is a separate 4 x 3.5. x 3. Cm rubbery tan-white mass. This mass approaches at least near. to the pleural surface. The larger lesion has yellow-orange. discoloration surrounding it, suggestive of surrounding pneumonia. The remainder of the parenchyma is spongy and red-purple without. additional lesions.

The following template summarizes the findings in this. case: Histologic type: Both of the mass lesions consist of poorly. differentiated non-small cell carcinoma. There are areas that it is. favored have squamous differentiation, as well as less frequent. foci suggestive of glandular differentiation (adenocarcinoma). Although not entirely identical, the two lesions look similar. Histologic grade: Poorly differentiated. Primary tumor (pT) These two lesions are grossly 2.6 cm and 4 cm. in greatest dimension. The 2.6 cm in diameter lesion has visceral. pleural invasion, with the larger lesion extending very. peripherally but without definite visceral pleural invasion. Although it is difficult to definitely distinguish between. synchronous primaries and the two masses being part of the same. process, given the similarities in appearance, based on the new. guidelines, two nodules of similar histology in the same lobe. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION. would be classified as pT3. Clinical correlation is recommended. Margins of resection: The bronchial and vascular resection margins. are negative. Direct extension of tumor: Visceral pleural extension for the 2. 6. cm in diameter lesion, no direct extension identified for the larger. lesion. Vascular invasion: Not definitively identified. Regional lymph nodes (pN) : pNl. There is metastatic carcínoma in. one of three hilar lymph nodes in part A. The separately submitted. lymph nodes in parts B, C, D, and E are negative for malignancy.

Addendum Diagnosis: Well-differentiated Astrocytoma, grade II in background of cortical dysplasia. Microscopic Description: Sections demonstrate a mildly to moderately hypercellular glial neoplasm that diffusely. infiltrates white matter as well as gray matter. In the latter, focal perineuronal. satellitosis is seen. The tumor predominantly resembles gemistocytes, although some. fibrillary astrocytes are seen. Although the nuclei tend to be round to oval, perinuclear. halos or other definite indications of oligodendroglioma differentiation are not seen. Atypia is mild to moderate.

CARCINOMA OF PANCREAS. Gross Description. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and. ""pancreatic duodenectomy"" is a previously dissected specimen so. designated with the included loop of duodenum measuring 17 cm. along the greater curve. The proximal margin reveals a staple. closure and appears pylorus-sparing and demonstrates a. circumference of 4.5 cm. The proximal staple line is removed. and the freshly exposed surface is lightly inked blue. The. distal duodenum reveals a staple closure as well and a. circumrerence of 5 cm with the circumference measuring 4.5 cm at. the level of the ampulla. The common duct has been previously. opened and measures 5.5 cm in length with a proximal. circumrerence of 2 cm diminishing to 0.8 cm at the ampulla. The. mucosa or the common duct is relatively smooth and yellow/tan. The duodenum in the area of the ampulla reveals a discrete area. of induration and effacement over an area measuring 2 x 1.5 cm. which corresponds to a relatively well-demarcated, firm and. yellow/tan mass occupying the head of the pancreas with the mass. measuring 3 X 3 X 3 cm in greatest dimensions. The pancreatic. resection margin measures 3.3 x 1.5 cm and has been previously. inked black. The pancreas itself measures overall 6 cm superior. to inferior X 3.5 cm right to left x 4.5 cm anterior to. posterior. Soft tissue inferior to the pancreas has been. previously inked black in a ragged area where there is a suture. designated as identifying a portion of superior mesenteric. vein. This area of tissue is indurated and continuous with the. previously described inferior pancreatic tumor. The tumor is. separated from the pancreatic resection margin by a minimum of. 2. cm grossly normal pancreas. The section code is as follows: A1=shave of pancreatic resection margin; A2=shave of distal. duodenal margin; A3=proximal duodenum parallel to the lumen,. posterior, with proximal aspect inked blue after removing staple. closure; A4=shave of proximal common duct resection margin;.

B) 19q loss. Interpretation of findings: A) (negative) The majority of tumors cells displayed 2 to 3 control. chromosome 1q25 signals and 2 to 3 chromosome 1p36 signals. (locus of interest), and the ratio of 1p36/1q25 Ratio was >0.8. The. results are consistent with no loss of the 1p36 locus of interest. B) (positive) The majority of tumors cells displayed 2 control. chromosome 19p13 signals and 1 chromosome 19q13 signals (locus of. interest) The ratio of 19q13/19p13 is <0.8. The results are. consistent with the loss of 1p36 locus of interest. Number of Observers: 2. Test Interpreted By. Comments. The resultant FISH section/slide is scanned by a trained licensed. medical technologist and analyzed using a FDA-approved, validated. semi-automated scanning imaging workstation. and accompanying imaging. analysis software. The resultant FISH section/slide is then. presented to the interpreting Pathologist, who will reviews the FISH. results from. and compares them to the results manually observed. under an Olympus Fluorescence Microscope. Therefore the ratio is enumerated. by computer-aided counting. as well as manual counting. Interpretation of Test. The ratio for probe set 1 is derived by dividing the total number of. LSI 1p36 signals by the total number of LSI 1q25 signals in at least 20. interphase nuclei with. nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic glial cells. Cells with no signals. or with signals of only one color are disregarded. The ratio for probe set. 2 is derived by dividing the total number of LSI 19q13 signals by the total. F/. number of LSI 19p13 signals in at least 2 sets of 20 interphase nuclei with. nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic glial cells at two different areas. of the sample. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are. disregarded. References ranges for our laboratory for allelic loss versus. no allelic loss were established by evaluating both probe sets in a series. of 40 normal cases from 10 different organs. For both probe set 1 and 2 a. ratio of less than 0.80 taken from at least 2 sets of 20 interphase nuclei. at 2 different areas with nonoverlapping nuclei is consistent with allelic. loss. FISH and H&&E stained slides have been reviewed by the. interpreting pathologist. Limitations. ANALYTE SPECIFIC REAGENT: The use of one or more reagents in the above. tests is regulated as an analyte specific reagent (ASR) . These tests were. developed and their performance characteristics determined by the Pathology. Core Facility of. They have not. been cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has. determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. Addendum. A and B: Right parietal temporal region, excision. - Mixed oligoastrocytoma (WHO grade II).

COMMENT. Sections show a poorly differentiated central tumor with focal evidence. of squamous differentiation. The tumor focally invades small venous. vessels. By immunohistochemistry the tumor stains positive for high. molecular weight keratin, CK5/6, and p63, focally positive for CD56, and. negative for CK7, CK20, TTF-1, chromogranin, and synaptophysin,. consistent with squamous cell carcinoma. Selected slides from the. patient' S previous resection. were reviewed for comparison,. and show a squamous cell carcinoma with extensive keratinization that. appears morphologically different from the present tumor. While a. dedifferentiated metastasis cannot be definitively excluded, the present. lung tumor is therefore favored to represent a second primary squamous. cell carcinoma, stage pT2N1.

The majority of the tumor cells demonstrate prominent perinuclear halos. They consistently have round. to oval nuclei. Atypia is moderate. Cellularity is accentuated in a multinodular pattern. Neither. microvascular proliferation nor necrosis are identified. A few scattered mitotic figures are seen, but. these are insufficient by themselves to warrant classification as anaplastic. Scattered MIB-1 reactive cells are present throughout the tumor. However, even in the most. proliferative regions, a labeling index of only 2.2% is calculated. Combined with the other histologic. features, this does not warrant classification as anaplastic/grade III.

COMMENT: While some of the lesion is grade II, tissue in 1A has the. cellularity, nuclear atypia, and mitotic activity of a grade III. lesion. The MIB-1 rate is approximately 5%. While there are some. oligodendroglioma features, i.e. round uniform nuclei and. perivascular haloes, the tumor, overall, has features of astrocytoma. Molecular studies found changes consistent with loss of. heterozygosity on 19q, but not on 1p. As such, the 1p/19q codeletion. associated with oligodendroglioma was not present. Isolated loss of. 19q is not uncommon in astrocytomas. Some stains/iests used in arriving at the diagnosis were performed here using reagents that have not been. cleared or approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.

Fish Ordered: METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Her? analysis was performed using the FDA approved Dako HercepTest (TM) test kit. i) using rabbit anti-human HER2. This assay was not modified. External kit-slides. provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-. house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well. preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2. immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided. by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from. ASCO and CAP and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. Pathology. Department takes full responsibility for this test's performance. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit. Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED. Clinical Interpretation of results. Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17 centromeric probe and a HFR-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the F. by Dr. A majority of tumors cells displayed moderate polysomy 17. with 2 to 4 chromosome 17 signals and 2 to 4 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0,. consistent with no amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used. Source of case: Tissue fixation. formalin-fixed tissue. Outside Case No:NA. Tissue source. breast Results interpreted: HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.1. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-. 2/neu. gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test. FDA APPROVED REAGENT. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of. patients for whom Herceptin® therapy is being considered.

Block Number: E10. ER: Negative Allred Score: 0 = Proportion Score 0 + Intensity Score 0. PR: Negative Allred Score: 0 = Proportion Score 0 + Intensity Score 0. COMMENT: The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the. proportion score (0 = no staining, 1 = <1% of cells staining, 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11-30% of. cells staining, 4 = 31-60% of cells staining, 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak. intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate intensity of staining, 3 = strong intensity of staining), with a scoring. range from 0 to 8. ER/PR positive is defined as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is defined as an Allred score. of less than or equal to 2. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Immunohistochemistry was performed using the mouse anti-human ER (ER 1D5, 1:100) and PR (PGR. 136, 1:100) provided by Dakc. bllowing the manufacturer s instructions. This. assay was not modified. Interpretation of the ER/PR immunohistochemical stain is guided by published. results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal. review of staining performance. SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST HER-2 RESULTS. Specimen: Surgical Excision. Block Number: E10. Interpretation: EQUIVOCAL. Intensity: 2+. % Tumor Staining: 15%. Fish Ordered: Yes, on Date. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Her2 analysis was performed using the FDA approved Dako HercepTest (TM) test kit. C. using rabbit anti-human HER2. This assay was not modified. External kit-slides. provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-. house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well. preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2. immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided. by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. This assay has been validated according to the. int recommendations and guidelines from. ASCO and CAP and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. The Pathology. Department takes full responsibility for this test's performance. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit. Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED. Clinical Interpretation of results. Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17. centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the. by Dr. A majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17. signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no. amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used E10. Source of case: Tissue fixation. formalin-fixed tissue. Outside Case No: NA. Tissue source. breast Results interpreted: HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.03. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-. 2/neu. gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test. FDA APPROVED REAGENT. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of. patients for whom Herceptin therapy is being considered. These tests were performed in the. under the direction. of Dr. The results of these studies should always be interpreted in the context of the. clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic diagnosis.

Lung (right middle lobe), wedge biopsy: Benign pulmonary parenchyma with pleural adhesions. COMMENTS: The endobronchial tumor in the right lower lobe (block B2) is stained with a battery of immunohistochemical stains to better categorize the nature of the. tumor. The tumor cells are strongly reactive with high molecular weight cytokeratin (SK) and greater than 70% of the tumor cell nuclei are positive with. p63. CD56. marks about 5-10% of the tumor cell cytoplasm and cytokeratin 5/6 marks approximately 20-30% of the tumor cells. Cytokeratin 7 and thyroid. transcription. factor-1 (TTF-1) are negative. These stains support a diagnosis of poorly differentiated squamous carcinoma. The mildly positive CD56. indicates a small component of a neuroendocrine carcinoma. The positive control slides for CK7. TTF-1, CD56, p63, and SK are appropriate. The. positive control for CK5/6 is assigned to case. CLINICAL INFORMATION. CLINICAL HISTORY: Preoperative Diagnosis: Right lower lobe lung cancer.

COMMENT: The tumor is composed of monomorphic spindie cells with cosinophilic cytoplasm, cigar-shaped nuclei and stippled. chromatin, perinuciear vacuoles. The spindle cells are arranged in both a vague storiform pattern and in short bundles. Mitoses are rare and difficult to find. There is no necrosis. Cells are mingled with typhocytes. There are many areas. of. myxoid change. Despita the relatively bland appearance tumor infiltrates in between normal smooth muscle. bundles of the bladder wall and focally Into the prostate. The tumor also encases the left ureter and abuts the. urothelium but does not disrupt it. The tumor cells resemble smooth muscle cells, and the InItIal blopsy#. ) had revealed strong. immunopositivity for desmin and actin and ckit and CD34 were negative. Whether the tumor is primary in the urinary. bladder or pelvic soft tissue may be a moot point, however the striking Infiltrative pattern and myxold changes support. the diagnosis of a lelomyosarcoma. Additional Immunohistochemical stains have been ordared and will be reported in an addendum. Addendum. Immunostains reveal the tumor is immunopositive for Desmin and AMA and demonstrates less than 5% positivity with Ki-67,. marker prollferation. The cytokeratin AE1/3 and S-100 were negative. The positive, negative and internal controls are. appropriate. This supports the above diagnosis.",SARC,Sarcoma,42.0,MALE,WHITE,,,,1622.0,1622.0,1622.0,1622.0,8.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0

NOTE: The origin of the tumor, a serous adenocarcinoma, is most likely of. ovarian origin, although there is some. degree of uncertainty. Key features. are (1) large size of the ovarian tumor and (2) WT-1 reactivity which is. usually positive in ovarian serous primaries, but usually negative in. endometrial serous primaries. While there was a past history of endometrial. tumor detected by pap smear, it is possible this is from cells shed by the. ovarian tumor that have passed through the reproductive canal. The tumor also. occupies half of the endometrial polyp, including its interior, which is not. typical for a metastasis, but certainly can be expected if present for some. period of time, The polyp arises in the lower uterine segment and has. prolapsed into the cervix.

COMMENT: A high percentage of tumor cells (greater than 20%) immunostaining for MGMT has been reported to be. associated with a relatively diminished response to Temodar. Hence,. the low 5% result in this case suggests a likelihood of this tumor being responsive to Temodar. Recent studies have shown that co-expression of EGFRvIII and PTEN as detected by immunostaining. was significantly correlated with a clinical response of glioblastomas to EGFR kinase inhibitors. Hence the preserved expression of PTEN in this case, when combined. with EGFRVIII mutation, permits a possibility of this tumor being responsive to EGFR-kinase inhibitors.",GBM,Glioblastoma multiforme,63.0,FEMALE,WHITE,,,,205.0,205.0,,84.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,,1.0,0.0

It consists of a. 360 gram radical nephrectomy. specimen consisting of kidney measuring 10.0 x 6.0 X 6.0 cm and. perinephric fat ranging from 0.3 up to 5.0 cm. Dissection through the fat. discloses no obvious lesions, masses or nodal tissue however, there is a. firm bulging mass at the hilum protruding from the kidney. Also at the. hilum there is an 8.0 X 0.3 cm segment of ureter. The ureter is opened. and grossly free of lesions or masses. The kidney is sectioned disclosing. a 4.0 x 3.5 x 2.7 cm soft orange mass having a moderate amount of. hemorrhage and possible degenerative changes. It is difficult to tell. whether the tumor is through the capsule however, the lesion does push. well into the hilum and renal pelvis. The calyceal system and vessels are. uninvolved by lesion. Elsewhere, two small simple cysts [cortical cysts]. containing clear thin fluid are found measuring 0.9 and 1.0 cm. Both. cysts are lateral and superiorly in the kidney.

The prostate gland contains three foci of prostatic adenocarcinoma. All tumor foci are located in the peripheral zone. The. dominant tumor focus is located in the right anterior, right anterolateral, right lateral, right posterolateral, right posterior, mid. posterior and left posterior peripheral zone with extension into the right transition zone. This tumor focus measures 2.6 x 1.6 cm in. the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in the three cross sections of the prostate and extensively in the apex and. base. regions. The tumor exhibits extraprostatic extension in the right lateral surface of the prostate, right superior neurovascular. bundle region and base region anterior to the right seminal vesicle. At the site of extraprostatic extension, the margin of resection. is. free. of. tumor. In the anterior apical region, tumor extends to the inked margin of resection. The extent of the positive margin is. 4.0 mm. At the site of the positive margin, no extraprostatic tissue is present to identify the possible presence of extraprostatic. extension. This. tumor focus invades the right seminal vesicle (intraprostatic and extraprostatic portions) and left seminal vesicle. (intraprostatic portion). Vascular lymphatic invasion is present within the prostate as well as within the intraprostatic portion of the. left. seminal. vesicle. The second tumor focus is located in the left lateral and left posterolateral peripheral zone. This tumor focus. measures 0.6 x 0.4 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in the first cross section of the prostate and focally. in. the apical region. The third tumor focus is located in the left lateral and left posterolateral peripheral zone, This tumor focus. measures 0.7 x 0.3 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in the last cross section of the prostate. The. non-dominant tumor foci are of lower histologic grade and confined to the prostate with negative margins. GROSS DESCRIPTION.

Data Analysis: DESCRIPTION OF THE ASSAY: 1p and 19q FISH studies were performed on. paraffin embedded tumor sections. Two hybridizations were performed: one with a 1p/1q probe/control pair and one with a 19q/19p. probe/control pair. The 19q and 1p probes map to regions that are. commonly deleted in gliomas. The nuclei are counterstained with DAPI. and the cells examined by epi-fluorescence microscopy. The total. number of counts for each probe is determined in 200 cells and the. ratios of 1p/1q and 19q/19p are calculated. Normal range: The normal ratio is approximately 1. Any ratio > 0.80 is. considered normal. LIMITATIONS: Low levels of malignant cells in the specimen can result. in a false negative result. As with all laboratory tests, sampling. error and other factors may affect the outcome of the assay. Correlation of results with other clinical and laboratory data should. be obtained. COMMENT: This test was developed and its performance characteristics. determined by the. It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

TCGA-A5-A0GV,"Copies To: Date Received: DIAGNOSIS: A. UTERUS, FALLOPIAN TUBES, AND OVARIES: - Primary uterine adenocarcinoma, endometrioid type with associated squamous changes,. FIGO grade I, nuclear grade 2 (see comment). Tumor extensively involves the mucosa of the uterine fundus and uterine corpus. Carcinoma also extends into lower uterine segment. Myometrial invasion by tumor is present superficially (less than 50% of wall is. involved). Dislodged fragments of tumor are present within some endothelial-lined spaces,. including veins; an iatrogenic process is favored over true lymphovascular invasion. by tumor. Cervix, including surgical margin is negative for tumor. No involvement of parametrial tissues by tumor. No evidence of metastatic carcinoma involving ovaries or fallopian tubes. Other findings include: Foci of endometrial glandular hyperplasia, simple and complex types with varying. degrees with associated atypia. Some inactive/weakly proliferative endometrium. Tiny benign endometrial and endocervical polyps and a small mixed endometrial-. endocervical polyp. Several small uterine leiomyomas, some with associated hyalinization. Adenomyosis. Cervix also shows focal changes suggestive of prior curettage, acute and chronic. inflammation, squamous metaplasia, reactive epithelial changes, cystic endocervical. tunnel clusters and nabothian cysts.

Labeled with the patient's name, labeled ""uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries"", and received fresh in the. Operating Room for frozen section and subsequently fixed in formalin, is a 68 gram total hysterectomy and bilateral. salpingo-oophorectomy specimen. The uterus is about 6.5 x 5.5 x 3.0 cm in greatest overall dimensions. The. cervix is 2.8 cm long and up to 3.0 cm in diameter. The endometrial cavity is about 4.5 cm long and up to 3.7 cm in. width. The uninvolved endometrium has a maximum thickness of 0.2 cm. The muscular uterine wall ranges from. about 1.1 to 1.4 cm in thickness. The fimbriated right fallopian tube is 4.3 cm long and ranges from 0.2 to 0.4 cm in. diameter with a maximum luminal diameter of 0.1 cm. The right ovary is 2.6 x 1.1 x 0.7 cm. The fimbriated left. fallopian tube is 5.2 cm long and ranges from 0.2 to 0.3 cm in diameter with a maximum luminal diameter of less. than 0.1 cm. The left ovary is about 2.1 x 1.4 x 0.5 cm. In the anterior uterine fundus, there is a soft friable exophytic/polypoid tumor mass that is about 2.3 x 0.8 x 0.2 cm. Cut sections in the vicinity of the polypoid lesion reveal superficial involvement of the underlying myometrium by. tumor. Much of the rest of the mucosa of the adjacent uterine corpus and lower uterine segment shows irregular. slightly shaggy pale tan and focally friable endometrium that may also be involved by tumor. Also received in the. same container is a separate 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm aggregate of similar-appearing soft friable tan tumor. The cervix. appears grossly free of tumor. Attached to the uterus there is a small amount of parametrial soft tissue, bilaterally. that also appears grossly free of tumor. No metastatic tumor is seen in the ovaries or fallopian tube. Within the uterus there are three well-circumscribed intramural leiomyomas, ranging from about 0.8 to 1.0 cm in. maximum dimension. Each of the leiomyomas are composed of firm solid tan-white tissue without grossly evident. areas of hemorrhage or necrosis. The cervix is remarkable only for several mucous-filled cysts ranging from less. than 0.1 to about 0.3 cm in diameter. Both ovaries are atrophic and show no gross pathologic lesions.

TCGA-FF-8061,"Histopathology Report. Received Date/Time. Reporting Information. Date/Time : Histopathologist : Laboratory : Consultant-In-Charge -. Histopathology Report. DIAGNOSIS. Small intestine and sigmoid colon: Diffuse large. B-cell lymphoma. Comment: The specimen shows lymphomatous. involvement by diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The. phenotype is in keeping with germinal centre. B-cell (GCB) type by Hans' criteria although the. expression of FoxP1 and weak immunostaining for. LMO2 has been reported in the activated B-cell. (ABC) subtype. GROSS DESCRIPTION. The specimen is received in formalin, labelled with patient's data, and. designated ""small bowel tumour with sigmoid colon"" It consists of an enblock. resection of small bowel tumour mass together with adherent segments of small. and large bowel. The small bowel loops are twisted and kinked, with part of. them entrapped within the encircling tumour mass, measuring in total. approximately 70cm in length and 8cm in diameter. The tumour mass measures 15 x. 14 x 9cm, located 7cm from far end and 4cm from near end of the small bowel. It. has a fish-flesh pale pink appearance on cut sections. The large bowel is. attached to the external surface of the tumour mass, measuring 9cm in length. and. 4. 5cm in circumference. The mucosa of the bowel appears unremarkable. The. external surface of the tumour is inked blue. Also received a piece of. cross. stapled bowel measuring 6 x 3.5 x 1cm. No discrete lesions are seen. definite lymph nodes are identified in this specimen. (A1-far margin of small bowel, A2-near margin of small bowel, A3&A4-shaved. margins of large bowel, A5 to A8-tumour with entrapped small bowel,. A9&A10-tumour with adjacent mucosa). MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION. Sections show a transmural lymphomatous infiltrate in the small intestine,. featuring a diffuse infiltrate of large lymphoid cells with scattered tingible. body macrophages, imparting a focally 'starry sky' appearance. Neoplastic cells. display vesicular chromatin, moderate nuclear pleomorphism, prominent nucleoli. and scattered mitoses. Immunohistochemistry confirms the neoplastic lymphoid. cells to be of B-cell lineage with expression of CD20 and PAX5. They co-express. germinal centre markers CD10, bcl6 and heterogeneous staining for LMO2. At the. same time there is also weak and heterogeneous expression of MUM1, as well as. strong immunoreactivity for FoxPl. No residual follicular dendritic meshworks. are seen with immunostaining for CD21. The proliferation fraction is high at. >90% and there is strong expression of the anti-apoptotic molecule bc12 in most. tumour cells, thereby excluding Burkitt lymphoma. Immunohistochemical stains with CD20 and PAX5 demonstrate scattered small B. lymphocytes and CD3 stains T lymphocytes.

The fourth container is received without formalin for intraoperative frozen. section consultation labeled ""D-left upper lobe bronchial margin,"" and contains. a lobectomy specimen measuring 14.5 X 9.5 X 3.2 cm. The bronchial margin is. left open. The bronchial margin is trimmed and submitted for frozen section. diagnosis, with the residual tissue now resubmitted for permanent section in. cassette D1. The pleural surface is blue-gray and smooth-glistening with a. reticular pattern of black pigmentation. The pleura is somewhat fibrotic and. puckered in one area, overlying a palpable mass. The lung parenchyma is stapled. in. three short segments near the hilum. Each of these three segments is trimmed. and the resulting cut surface is inked black. Sectioning through the lung. reveals a mass measuring 5.0 X 4.1 X 2.4 cm involving the above noted pleural. surface. The mass has a heterogeneous white-tan, fibrous cut surface with. speckling of black pigmentation. The mass approaches up to the pleural surface. Two lymph nodes are present at the bronchial hilum measuring 0.4 and 1.2 cm in. diameter. The mass appears grossly to be confluent with possible. intraparenchymal lymph nodes.

Date Complete: Addendum Comment. At the request of Dr. a representative portion of this case was. sent for EGFR mutation analysis to. This addendum is. created only to report those findings. MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY. EGFR MUTATION ANALYSIS. Patient ID #: Date Collected: Date Received: Client Lab ID #: Treating Physician: Hospital ID #: Client Specimen ID: Body Site: Left. lung. Specimen(s) Received: Paraffin embedded tissue. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: No mutation detected. INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified; however, 18-20% of patient with non-small-cell. lung cancer and without identifiable mutations are reported to be responsive to. EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies. COMMENT: This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain; based on the. current literature, the vast majority of mutations are expected to occur in. these exons. The analytical sensitivity of the assay is 10-20%, thus mutations. present in a low percentage of cells may not be detected. Most data published to date pertain to gefitinib (Iressa). Similar data have. been seen in studies using erlotinib (Tarceva). A frequently occurring sequence change 2361 G>A was identified. This. polymorphism is not likely to have clinical significance. This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The clinical. significance and utility of this test in other tumor types is unknown. METHOD LIMITATION: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant rumor is selected or. analysis, DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified and amplified by. polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using. capillary electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or negative. results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants or somatic. heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

H. atypical lymphoid cells in the red pulp. The atypical lymphoid cells. range in size from medium sized to large, they have abundant pale. cytoplasm. Immunohistochemistry studies were performed for CD20, CD5, CD3, CD21,. CD23, IgD, MIB-1 and cyclinD1. The atypical lymphoid cells are CD20. positive, CD5 and CD23. CD3 and CD5 highlight background T cells. CD. 21 demonstrates residual follicular dendritic cell meshworks. The. atypical cells are negative for cyclinD1 and lgD. A moderate. proliferation rate is illustrated by the MIB-1 immunostain. We favor a diagnosis of low grade B cell lymphoma; the differential. diagnoses include splenic marginal zone lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic. leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) and mantle cell lymphoma. Negativity for cyclinD1 argues against a mantle cell lymphoma. The. pattern of involvement is more in favor of a splenic marginal zone. lymphoma than CLL/SLL (i.e. the clusters of atypical cells in the red. pulp and the predominant involvement of the white pulp). CD5. positivity can be seen in marginal zone lymphoma. In specimen #2, the pheochromocytoma shows nested tumor cells that are. positive for chromogranin and synaptophysin. Surrounding adipose. tissue is infiltrated by atypical monotonous lymphoid cells that are. CD20 positive. Immunoperoxidase and in-situ hybridization tests performed here and. used for diagnosis were developed and their performance characteristics. determined by the Laboratory of Pathology,. They have not been. cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA. has also determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary.

NEGATIVE: No evidence of methylated MGMT promoter is detected. Results-Comments. Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block. TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter. have been shown to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents. Assessment. of. MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA. followed. by real-time PCR amplification (MethyLight) of methylated and unmethylated. DNA. sequences. The analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial. dilution of methylated positive control DNA into unmethylated DNA, and was. assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated DNA. Factors such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the sample, or. extensive tissue necrosis, may preclude the detection of methylated MGMT. promoter sequences.

Uterus, cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries, hysterectomy. with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: Tumor characteristics: Specimen integrity: Intact, received previously opened. Histologic type: Papillary serous carcinoma. Histologic grade: III (high grade). Tumor site: Endometrial cavity. Tumor size: 6.2 x 3.5 x 1.0cm. Myometrial invasion: No unequivocal myometrial invasion identified. in sections examined. Involvement of cervix: Not identified. Extent of involvement of other organs: Single microscopic focus of. involvement of the left. ovary (see comment). Lymphovascular space invasion: Present. Surgical margin status: Surgical margins appear free of malignancy in sections examined. Lymph node status: See below. Other: Cervix: No significant histopathologic change. Endometrium: Inactive pattern. Myometrium: Leiomyomata; adenomyosis. Fallopian tubes: No significant histopathologic change. Ovary, right: No significant histopathologic change. Stage: pT3a N1. Lymph node, right pelvic, excision: Metastatic carcinoma involving one of one lymph node (1/1). Tumor up to 2.0 cm in greatest dimension. No extracapsular tumor extension identified in sections examined. Lymph nodes, left aortic: Six lymph nodes negative for metastatic carcinoma (0/6). ""Lymph node"", right aortic: Benign fibroadipose tissue; no lymph node identified. Omentum, omentectomy: Benign fibroadipose tissue consistent with omentum. No histologic evidence of carcinoma identified in sections. examined. I. CPT: Comments. Histologic sections demonstrate a poorly differentiated papillary. serous carcinoma involving much of the endometrial cavity. While. grossly suspicious for invasion, no definitive myometrial invasion. is identified in the muitiple sections examined. However, within the. left ovary a single microscopic focus of tumor (less than 1 mm) with. associated hemorrhage and necrosis is noted. Though microscopic,. this is consistent with an area of adnexal involvement. Clinical. correlation is recommended.

Left kidney tumor mass #3, excision: Papillary renal cell carcinoma with. capsular disruption and multiple small papillary neoplasms in adjacent kidney; see. comment. COMMENT: All three tumor resection specimens contain multiple papillary neoplams. In parts A and F, the dominant. tumors are composed of papillary excrescences lined by realatively small cuboidal to low-columnar cells. with primarily clear cytoplasm. The epithelial cell nuclei are moderately enlarged and round to oval with. small nucleoli. The papillae contain fibrovascular cores, some with prominant foamy macrophages. The. histology is that of type I papillary carcinoma. Hemorrhage and psammoma bodies are seen throuphout the. lesions. in part A. at least four additional microfoci of papillary proliferations similar to the dominant. mass cell carcinoma are seen in the adjacent grossly normal renal parenchyma. In part F, a 1.2 cm. dominant papillary renal cell carcinoma is seen in association with three additional microfoci of papillary. prolierationsare seen in the adjacent renal parenchyma. In part C, a 0.8 cm dominant mass composed of nests of cells with eosinophilic granular cytoplasm and. small round nuclei with prominant nucleoli is seen in association with two microfoci of papillary neoplasia. While the the minute papillary proliferations fall short of the size criterion for the diagnosis of papillary. renal cell carcinoma (they are < 5 mm in diameter) their histolgic resemblence to the definitive foci of. papillary renal cell carcinoma and the finding of multifocal papillary renal cell carcinoma suggest that these. small lesions may have more in common with papillary carcinoma than with isolated small tumors of the. type that are called adenomas. In part F, the renal capsule adjacent to the dominant tumor is disrupted, however, it is not clear that this is. tumor capsular penetration as oppsed to artifact associated with specimen handling and transport. Select slides were shown at the departmental. and the faculty in attendance. concurred with the above diagnoses.

The patient is a. lyear-old man with a left renal mass. He undergoes partial nephrectomy. Gross Description. The specimen is received in formalin in six parts, each labeled with the patient's name and medical record. number. Part A is additionally labeled ""anterior mass left kidney."" It consists of a single fragment of brown renal. tissue, notable for a single nodular mass protruding from the capsular surface. The specimen measures. 3.5 x 3.0 x 2.4 cm. The mass measures 2.7 x 2.4 cm and protrudes above the capsular surface 1.1 cm. The surface of the mass is partially covered by a thin, translucent membrane, which is partially retracted. The specimen is unoriented. The kidney resection margin is inked with black ink. The specimen is serially. sectioned, revealing a hemorrhagic, partially cystic mass that appears to infiltrate the renal cortex. The. mass approaches to within 1 mm of the black-inked margin. The specimen is entirely submitted in. cassettes A1 through A7. Part B is additionally labeled ""Gerota's, ink marks area adjacent to mass, suture marks external margin."" It. consists of an irregular fragment of lobulated, yellow, adipose tissue, measuring 7.5 x 3.5 x 1.5 cm. Opposing sides of the roughly flat tissue fragment are partially epithelialized; one side is inked with purple. ink, and the other is marked with a black suture. These represent the sides adjacent to the tumor and. external surface, respectively. The inked surface is notable for focal areas of fibrous nodularity. The. sutured surface is glistening, smooth, and unremarkable. The specimen is inked as follows: inked surface. is re-inked with blue ink, and the sutured surface is inked with black ink. Representative sections are. submitted as follows: Cassettes B1-B2: Region of slight nodularity in the area of heaviest initial surgical inking. Part C is additionally labeled ""peri-mass fat renal tumor."" It consists of a single discoid fragment of. lobulated, yellow, adipose tissue, measuring 6.0 x 4.0 x 1.2 cm. One surface is notable for a roughly. circular fragment of fibrous membrane, measuring 3.0 x 2.5 cm. The surface of the membranous structure. is smooth, glistening, and without lesions. The membrane area is inked with black ink. The specimen is. serially sectioned, revealing unremarkable lobulated, yellow, adipose tissue. A representative section is. submitted in cassette C1. Part D is additionally labeled ""left kidney mass #2."" It consists of a single roughly spherical fragment of. tan-brown, soft tissue, measuring 1.5 x 1.5 x 1.4 cm. The tissue consists of a fragment of renal tissue and. capsule surrounding a variegated tan and red-brown mass that projects above the renal surface a distance. of 0.6 cm. The specimen is not oriented. The surgical margin is inked entirely with black ink. The. specimen is serially sectioned, revealing a punctate, cystic, hemorrhagic cut surface with focal areas of. bright-yellow material located peripherally.

TCGA-78-8648,"HISTORY. Histopathology of right upper lobe and chest wall resection for cancer. MACROSCOPIC. Three specimens received. 1: The specimen is labelled ""right upper lobe"" and consists of a right upper. lobe with attached chest wall. The right upper lobe measures 140 x 100 x 79 mm. in maximum dimension. The chest wall component consists of four ribs and. measures 140 X 60 mm in maximum dimension. On the hilar surface there are two. vertical soft tissue excision margins which are closed with staples, the. longest of which measures 90 mm and the other measures 60 mm. The staples are. removed and the new resection margin is inked in blue. On sectioning the. specimen there is a large cavitating mass which has an ill-defined lobulated. appearance and measures, in maximum dimension, 58 X 55 mm. The tumour appears. to lie approximately 13 mm from the bronchial resection margin. The tumour. lies well clear of the longest soft tissue excision margin and approximately 8. mm from the shorter soft tissue excision margin. The chest wall is blunt. A. dissected off the main specimen. The tumour does not appear macroscopically to. have infiltrated the chest wall as there is a thickened greyish-white soft. N. fibrous-like capsule between the tumour and the chest wall. The tumour focally. A. appears to be very close to the serosal surface. The small amount of normal. lung parenchyma that is present appears unremarkable. [1A, bronchial resection.

Labelled ""Brain tumour"". Specimen consists of two irregular pieces of soft to firm cream tissue. measuring 7x5x2mm and 19x10x6mm. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION. Sections show brain tissue with focal areas of increased cellularity and in. some of these areas there are vacuolated cells (abundant cytoplasm) with. central nuclei and slightly pleomorphic hyperchromatic nuclei seen (high. mitotic count is seen in some areas up to 4/HPF x40). I think it is. consistent with oligodendrogliotio cells mixed with astrocytic cells. The adjacent brain tissue also shows a slight increase in cellularity. although there is less pleomorphism in this and no fried egg like areas. There is no evidence or necrosis. There are also branching networks of. capillary seen. The GFAP certainly demonstrated a network of astrocytic cells however in the. oligodendroglioti area the stromal clear cell in the.centre of this. fibrillary network leaving the clear cells unstained and the Ki-67 shows. focal area of high index 5-10% and in other areas is <48.

Procedures/Addenda: Addendum. Addendum. Immunostains for ER and PR are performed on representative blocks of the endometrial tumor (A16) and the tumor in. the right ovary (A12). The endometrial tumor is ER positive (1+, 20%) and PR weakly positive (1+, 2%). The tumor in. the ovary is ER positive (3+, 70%) and PR positive (3+, 65%). The tumor in the ovary is more strongly ER/PR positive than. the tumor in the endometrium, however the findings are still considered to be best classified as a primary endometrial. tumor with ovarian metastases. Clinical correlation is suggested. For cases in which immunostains are performed, the following applies: Appropriate internal and/or external positive and. negative controls have been evaluated.

COMMENT: Permanent sections of the colonic wall from the site of previous sigmoid polypectomy reveal an area of. adenomatous mucosa within the granulation tissue and focally on the surface. I cannot exclude the possibility that. the adenomatous mucosa in the granulation tissue is a focus of residual carcinoma. The change is not seen on. review of the frozen sections and only focally on the permanent sections of this specimen. That includes deeper. sections of the paraffin block. The surface adenomatous change is close to an inked margin but on deepers is not. seen to involve it.

Brain tumor, biopsy: Oligodendroglioma, WHO Grade II, see comment. Comment: Sections reveal an infiltrating neoplasm with largely uniform. histology composed of small cells with round nuclei, perinuclear halos,. and background chicken-wire like vasculature. Focal calcification and. microcystic changes are identified. Although much of the tumor is. diffusely infiltrating, a few nodular foci of tumor are appreciated. Extensive search fails to reveal definitive mitoses in this well-sampled. material. However, two microfoci of tumor show increased Ki-67. immunolabeling and mitoses are identified by immunohistochemical study. for phosphohistone H3 (a marker of mitotic spindles) . Immunohistochemical studies reveal strong GFAP reactivity within tumor. cell processes. P53 is positive in 10-15% of cell nuclei. Immunohistochemical study for IDH-1 (mutated isocitrate dehydrogenase-1. is strongly and diffusely reactive in the tumor. These findings support. an infiltrating oligodendrogli.oma which by lack of mitoses on H&E stain. would be considered a WHO Grade II tumor. The significance of the. microfoci of increased proliferation described above is uncertain. CHROMOSOMES 1P AND 190 ANALYSIS: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed on representative. paraftin-embedded tumor tissue. In this case, deletions of both 1p and 19q were identified.

""Uterus, tubes and ovaries"" (AF1-AF2), received fresh for frozen section. diagnosis is a 398 gram, 13.5 X 11.0 x 9.0 cm hysterectomy specimen with. attached cervix (5. 0 x 3.0 cm). The specimen was opened by the surgeon. The. serosal surface is markedly distorted by multiple subserosal and myometrial. leiomyomata, but otherwise grossly unremarkable. Opening the specimen. demonstrates a cervical canal (2.5 cm in length x 1.5 cm in diameter) which is. white-tan and has a herringbone pattern. The endometrial canal (7.5 cm in. length x 5.5 cm from cornu to cornu) is markedly distorted by large,. calcified, submucosal leiomyomas, the largest of which (5.0 x 4.6 x 4.2 cm) is. located in the anterior myometrium. Two other large, submucosal leiomyomas. are located in the posterior myometrium and measure 4. x 3.8 x 3.2 cm and 3.0. x 3.0 x 1.9 cm. All leiomyomas are calcified. The endometrium demonstrates. red-tan, hyperplastic mucosa with a fungating lesion located primarily on the. anterior side (4.5 x 3.5 cm) A photograph is taken. This fungating mass. is 0.9 cm of the anterior lower uterine segment. This area overlies the. largest calcified leiomyoma and for this reason we will not be able to obtain. full thickness sections in this area. The right fallopian tube is 6.0 cm in length x 0.5 cm in diameter and upon. sectioning grossly unremarkable. The right ovary (2.0 x 1.1 x 0.6 cm) is. white-tan, cerebriform and grossly unremarkable. The left fallopian tube (6.7. cm in length x 0.5 cm in diameter) is upon sectioning grossly unremarkable. The left ovary (1.2 x 1.1 x 0. cm) is white-tan, cerebriform and grossly. unremarkable.

The adrenal gland weighs 43.8 grams and appears mostly replaced by a well-circumscribed, golden yellow, septated. hemorrhagic mass (4.9 x 4.5 x 3.1 cm), extending to within 0.1 cm of the soft tissue resection margin, and to within 2.7 cm of the. vascular resection margin. A pinpoint (less than 0.1 cm diameter) golden yellow nodule is present on the surface of the clamped. adrenal vessel, and is located 0.3 cm from the vascular margin. Scant unremarkable adrenal tissue is identified, with golden brown. cortical tissue and brown medullary tissue. Tumor tissue is submitted for possible electron microscopic studies. The kidney contains a 2.3 x 2 x 1.5 cm well-circumscribed red brown, hemorrhagic mass at the anterior mid aspect,. abutting the renal sinus and renal pelvicalyceal system. This tumor nodule is at least 0.8 cm away from the soft tissue resection. margin, and widely free of the renal vascular and ureteric margins. There is no involvement of perinephric adipose tissue, renal. sinus adipose tissue, renal vein or Gerota's fascia. Multiple thin-walled cortical cysts containing hemorrhagic, opaque fluid are present within the cortex of the kidney. Additionally, the papillae appear yellow-white and shrunken. No other masses or lesions identified within the adjacent kidney. parenchyma. The pelvicalyceal system is smooth and devoid of any lesions. No lymph nodes are identified in the hilum of the. kidney.

Soft-tissue particles with chronic fibrosing inflammation (samples 1.) and 2.)). Lymph nodes. with uncharacteristic reactive lesions and anthracotic pigment deposits (samples 4.) - 11.)). Remark/addendum: The tumor extends peripherally to the visceral pleura in the area of adhesion with the parietal layer, there is no evidence. here to suggest infiltration of the visceral pleura.

The specimen reveals a widely-invasive classical variant papillary thyroid carcinoma that exhibits areas of Warthin-like. and hobnail cell change. There is also focal solid growth with cribriform and morular/squamoid architecture, which. accounts for less than 20% of the lesion and is characterized by increased mitotic activity (5/10 HPF) and apoptotic. change. These areas are positive for TTF-1 and thyroglobulin. Although some of these features may represent. microscopic dedifferentiation within this lesion, these features are unusual and therefore the clinical significance of these. findings is not well known. One of the focal components observed in this lesion is the cribriform and morular architecture, which is characteristic of. lesions that have been reported in association with the Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) syndrome. Although this is. not diagnostic of this entity, further clinical evaluation is recommended. Dr. i has also reviewed this case and she agrees with the diagnosis and interpretation. Synoptic Data.

The. bone is grossly consistent with a portion mandible, including part of the. ramus and posterior part of the body. On the medial aspect of the bone,. there is a irregular soft tissue partially covered with pink mucosa. On the. anteroinferior aspect, a round lobule of normal appearing salivary gland is. seen. Located in the center, there is an irregular ulcer identified,. measuring 3.5 cm (anteroposterior plane) x 3 cm (superoinferior plane) X 1.3. cm (mediolateral plane) The ulcer extends to within 0.5 cm of the anterior. mucosal margin, 0.8 cm of the superolateral margin, 1.0 cm of the posterior. margin and 0.3 cm of the inferomedial resection margins. No apparent intact. tonsil is identified. The attached salivary gland measures 3 X 1.9 X 1.5 cm. in maximal dimension and appears grossly unremarkable. The soft tissue. margins are composed predominantly of irregular tissue including muscle and. connective tissue as well as occasional fat. The tumor is not identified on. the surgical margins. There appears to be a small hemorrhagic polyp that is. 0.4 cm X 0.3 cm extending off of the posterolateral surface of the tonsil. No other gross abnormalities are identified. The specimen is inked as. follows: Anterior soft tissue margin - blue, inferomedial soft tissue margin. - yellow, posterior soft tissue margin - black, and superolateral soft tissue. margin - orange. Serial sections of the specimen demonstrate grayish white,. firm tumor mass extending to within approximately 0.3 cm of the inferior. (yellow) soft tissue margin, 0.7 cm from the superolateral (orange) , and 0.1. cm of the anterior soft tissue margin. Representative sections are submitted as follows: C1, C2 - anterior. resection margin (perpendicular to the inked margin) i C3, C4 - one complete. cross section of the tumor (C3 is inferior to C4) C5, C6 - one complete. cross section of the tumor (posterior to C3 and C4; C5 is inferior to C6) ;.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS: A) Lymph nodes, designated left neck dissection (level II and III),. excision: Metastatic carcinoma to one of 26 lymph nodes (1/11 level II lymph. nodes and 0/15 level III lymph nodes). No evidence of extracapsular soft tissue extension. B) Lymph nodes, designated left, level IA , excision: No evidence of. metastatic carcinoma in 4 lymph nodes (0/4). C). Tonsillar bed, portion of mandible and salivary gland, left, composite. resection: Invasive squamous cell carcinoma, with the following features: 1. Size: 3.5 cm in greatest dimension. 2. Moderately differentiated. 3. Carcinoma invades the underlying skeletal muscle, with very focal. invasion of minor salivary gland tissue; the submandibular salivary gland is. free of carcinoma. 4. Foci of angiolymphatic and perineural space invasion are identified. 5. The inked surgical margins are free of carcinoma. See comment. Invasive. carcinoma extends to within 0.1 cm of the anterior soft tissue resection. margin (C2), 0.1 cm of the cauterized inferomedial soft tissue resection. margin (C3),0.2 cm of the deep soft tissue resection margin (C1), 0.4 cm of. the posterior soft tissue mucosal resection margin (C11), and 0.9 cm of the. superolateral soft tissue resection margin (C6) . 6. No gross bony invasion is identified; pending decalcification. No gross involvement of bony margins is seen; pending decalcification. 8. See comment. D) Soft tissue, designated left, level III , excision: Benign fibroadipose. tissue; no lymph nodes are identified. E) Lymph nodes, designated level V , excision: No evidence of metastatic. carcinoma in 5 lymph nodes (0/5) . COMMENT: Carcinoma approximates inked margins in C7 and C8, however, on correlation. with gross appearance these foci are interpreted as tissue tear-distortion. with ink run-off and not as true inked margins. The minimal pTNM classification is pT2, pN1, pMx (AJCC staging manual, 6th. edition, 2002) . Assessment of bony invasion and bony margins is currently. pending (decalcification) The results will be reported as addendum. Procedures used to establish the diagnosis: Submit tissue for decalcification. ADDENDUM REASON: This addendum is issued to report the histologic findings in the. decalcification specimens. Additional representative bony margins are. submitted in cassettes C12 and C13. The overall diagnosis remains unchanged. ADDENDUM FINAL DIAGNOSIS: A) Lymph nodes, designated left neck dissection (level II and III),. excision: Metastatic carcinoma to one of 26 lymph nodes (1/11 level II lymph nodes and. 0/15 level III lymph nodes). No evidence of extracapsular soft tissue extension. B) Lymph nodes, designated left, level IA excision: No evidence of. metastatic carcinoma in 4 lymph nodes (0/4).

The first container is labeled ""right ovary, FS1/X. It. contains a previously bisected 360 gram tan-yellow ovarian mass. The mass. measures 12 x 10 x 7 cm. The serosal surface shows numerous bosselations. Focally, the capsule is ruptured and at this site the tumor is seen projecting. to the exterior. Also identified on the ovarian surface is a possible fallopian. tube measuring 4.5 cm in length and has a luminal diameter of 0.3 cm. The. fallopian tube grossly appears uninvolved. Further sectioning of the ovarian. mass shows a tan-yellow firm tumor mass which is solid in most part, but focally. shows cystic change and the inner surface of the cyst wall shows papillary. tan-white projections. Labeled A1 - possible right fallopian tube; A2 to A11 -. sections through the right ovarian tumor. The second container is labeled ""left adnexa.' It contains portions of. fallopian tube and with attached tan-yellow ovarian mass. The fallopian tube. measures 3.0 x 1.1 x 0.8 cm, and the attached ovarian mass measures 6.0 x 6.5 x. 4.0 cm. The mass weighs 60.5 grams. Sections through the fallopian tube show. portions of the serosal surface involved by the tumor, however, the mucosa. appears uninvolved. Part of the ovarian surface appears ragged, while part of. the ovarian surface is smooth and shows multiple tan-yellow papillary. excrescences on the surface. Based on the gross examination, it is not possible. to discern the primary site of the tumor (left ovary vs right ovary). Further. sectioning of the ovary reveals multiple nodular tan-yellow solid and papillary. tumors with focal areas of necrosis. Labeled B1 - sections through the. fallopian tube with the tumor at the serosal aspect; B2 to B8 - random sections. through the ovarian tumor. The third container is labeled ""bladder."" It contains three tan-yellow to. tan-pink fat and soft tissue fragments ranging from 2.0 to 5.0 cm in greatest. dimensions and 5.0 x 5.0 x 2.0 cm in aggregate.

THE FOLLOWING SPECIMEN IS FREE OF TUMOR: M. VENTRAL HERNIA SAC. NOTE: While many areas in the tumor are solid (estimated 308), the tumor is. classified as grade 2 since less than 50% is solid. ADDENDUM 1: This addendum is issued to report the results for immunostaining for HER2/neu. oncoprotein. The test is performed at the request of. Immunostaining for HER2/neu (c-erbB-2) oncoprotein is performed on recut. sections of block A2 (""left ovary"") . The immunostaining is done using DAKO. rabbit anti-human c-erbB-2 oncoprotein which is an affinity-isolated antibody. (DAKO product number A0485) The immunostaining is performed after antigen. retrieval by heating the unstained sections at 95 degrees centigrade for 20. minutes in 10 mM citrate buffer, pH 6.0 The primary antibody is used at a. dilution of 1:1500 (manual staining) or 1:2000 (autostainer), with an. incubation for one hour at 37 degrees centigrade. The Histostain Plus kit. (Zymed Laboratories) is used as the detection system. The histological. section consists predominantly of serous adenocarcinoma with areas of. papillary differentiation. The tumor has a variable immunostaining profile. The majority of the tumor has negligible staining of the cytoplasm or cell. membrane (score = 0) . There is a minority population of the tumor cells that. u1. has trace staining of the cytoplasm with mildly to moderately intense. circumferential staining of the cell membrane. These cells with. circumferential cell membrane staining are present as multiple foci scattered. throughout the tumor. This makes it difficult to estimate the overall tumor. population with the staining pattern indicative of weak overexpression of. HER2/neu oncoprotein, but I estimate that such cells account for approximately. 5% of the tumor cells. In summary, the serous adenocarcinoma present in the left ovary has a. subpopulation of tumor cells (approximately 5% of the total population) with. an immunostaining profile indicative of mild overexpression of HER2/neu. oncoprotein. I certify that I personally conducted the diagnostic evaluation of the above. specimen (s) and have rendered the above diagnosis (es).",OV,Ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma,51.0,FEMALE,WHITE,,,Complete Remission/Response,1470.0,1470.0,613.0,613.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,5.0

[Blocked as 2TS away from the staple line, 9A]. MICROSCOPY. 1: Sections show a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. There is prominent endobronchial. component. In situ squamous cell carcinoma extends to the bronchial resection margin but the margin. appears clear of invasive tumour. In one area, the overlying pleura appears thickened and scarred. There are features suspicious for pleural invasion within this area and special stains will be performed. to assess this. The tumour is not present on the pleural surface. No blood vessel, lymphatic or. perineural invasion is seen. The tumour appears to directly invade a peribronchial lymph node. The. adjacent lung shows no significant changes. 2: Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes only. There is no evidence of malignancy. 3: Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes only. There is no evidence of malignancy. 4: Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes only. There is no evidence of malignancy. 5: Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes only. There is no evidence of malignancy. 6: Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes only. There is no evidence of malignancy. 7: Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes and a small silicotic nodule. There is no. evidence of malignancy. 8: Sections show squamous cell carcinoma, which is surrounded by a dense fibrous capsule. Some. lymphoid aggregates present in this region and it is presumed that this deposit of squamous cell. carcinoma is present within a lymph node. An adjacent smaller lymph node is present and this shows. reactive changes only. No bronchial wall is present for assessment. Tumour extends extremely closely. to the diathermied resection margin. 9: Sections of the bronchus show a small amount of residual squamous cell carcinoma in situ. No. invasive carcinoma is seen.

In the permanent sections, there is an area with numerous glands. with no identifiable endometrial stroma that are as deep as 1.2 cm in the wall. (B6). A few of these have an associated desmoplastic stromal reaction and. these are interpreted as invasive. This area was not apparent grossly and was. therefore not sampled at the time of frozen section, accounting for the. difference in depth of invasion between the frozen section and final. diagnosis.

HER2 TEST VALIDATION. This HER2 immunohistochemical assay has been validated according to the recently revised recommendations and. guidelines from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force, and the jointly issued recommendations and. guidelines from ASCO and the CAP (5). 80 randomly selected breast cancer samples were tested for HER2 by IHC. as outline above and interpreted as, negative (score 0/1+) equivocal (score 2+) and positive (score 3+) without. knowledge of the previous reported results. These cases were also blindly read using two different FISH assay as amplified or non-amplified and the. HER2/CEP17 ratios were recorded. After analyzing these results, there was 100% concordance between the IHC. and FISH results for cases that were interpreted as either positive or negative by IHC. 9 of the 80 cases were. interpreted as equivocal by IHC and of these 3/9 (33%) were non-amplified by FISH and 6/9 (66%) were found to be. amplified. The Pathology Department Immunohistochemistry laboratory takes full responsibility for this tests performance. and has programs in place to regularly monitor the proficiency and the interpretation of HER2 assays. The. laboratory also participates in external quality assurance HER2 programs including the CAP proficiency testing. program. REFERENCE. 1.

GROSS DESCRIPTIONS. One appropriately labeled, formalin-filled, container is received. It contains a portion of right lobe of liver. weighing 321.2 grams and measuring 6.5 x 13.2 x 6.2 cm. cm. A small portion of tissue at the medial. side was sent for tissue procurement. The surgical margin is black. There is a 7.2 cm. (lateral to medial),. 3.6 cm. (anterior to posterior), and a 5.2 cm. (superior to inferior) firm, well demarcated mass at the. lateral side of the specimen. The mass is tan/white with focal bile staining. Grossly, the mass approaches. the the capsule on the anterior, posterior, and inferior surfaces, however the capsule appears intact. The. mass is 1.5 cm. away from the surgical margin. There is also a 0.7 cm. well demarcated small nodule. adjacent at the medial site which is separate from the main mass. The remaining liver parenchyma is. unremarkable. The attached gallbladder has been previously opened. The gallbladder appears. unremarkable. No stones are identified. BLOCK SUMMARY. 1 - lesion with lateral capsule. 2 lesion. 3 - lesion adjacent to the gallbladder. 4 - lesion adjacent to the gallbladder. 5 lesion. 6 lesion. 7 - surgical margin, adjacent to the gallbladder. 8-10 - additional section with surgical margin. 11 - smaller nodular lesion. 12 - normal appearing liver. 13 - surgical margin of cystic duct. 14 - representative section of gallbladder and additional. cystic duct section. LIGHT MICROSCOPY. Light microscopic examination is performed. Sections reveal that both of the grossly identified masses are moderately differentiated hepatocellular 1. carcinoma. The tumor cells have a cord-like distribution and display moderate nuclear atypia. The tumor. closely approaches the hepatic capsule, but does not invade through it. Apparent lymphovascular space. invasion is present within the liver in the area of the gallbladder bed. The surrounding, non-neoplastic. liver shows some bile stasis, which is predominantly intrahepatocellular. There is mild bile duct. proliferation and scattered neutrophilic aggregates within portal areas and sinusoids. These findings are. suggestive of a biliary obstruction, possibly secondary to the tumor. Also present are mild portal. lymphocytic infiltrates, consistent with a mild (Grade 1) chronic hepatitis. Viral cytopathic. effect is not noted. An iron stain shows no evidence of iron accumulation within the liver. There is no. evidence of fibrosis or cirrhosis.

COMMENT: The tumor cells demonstrate relatively uniform population with moderate cytologic atypia and up to 5 mitoses per 10 high. power fields. Therefore, it is considered a low grade lesion (please refer to the reference articles). Approximately 20% of. tumor cells show p53 nuclear positivity, further supporting the low grade nature of the lesion. Modest fibrosis and. scattered apoptotic bodies are seen, while no tumor necrosis or foam cell aggregate is identified, indicating minimal. response (< 5%) to chemotherapy. Both ovaries are involved by multiple large nodules of carcinoma. No Intraepithelial or invasive carcinoma is identified in. the fallopian tubes. Based on the criteria proposed by the. the tumor is considered. ovarian primary. Previous excisional biopsy of the umbilical stalk revealed the involvement of skin. the tumor is regarded as stage IV.

CERVICAL INVOLVEMENT: Present, with extensive stromal invasion (see above). ADNEXAL INVOLVEMENT (SEE BELOW): Not identified. CERVICAL/VAGINAL MARGIN AND DISTANCE: Negative; invasive carcinoma approaches to a distance of 0.2cm from the. anterior ectocervical mucosal margin. LYMPHOVASCULAR SPACE INVASION: Present. HORMONE RECEPTORS: Tumor is estrogen receptor negative (0) and progesterone receptor negative (0). REGIONAL LYMPH NODES (SEE OTHER SPECIMENS): No lymph nodes identified. TOTAL NUMBER INVOLVED: 0. TOTAL NUMBER EXAMINED: 0. AJCC PATHOLOGIC STAGE (classified as a primary uterine carcinoma): pT2b pNx pMx. FIGO STAGE GROUPING: IIB. These stages are basedoninformation available atthe time of this report, and are subject to change pending additional. information and clinical review. Ovary, right, oophorectomy: - No significant pathologic abnormality, negative for malignancy. Ovary, left, oophorectomy: - No significant pathologic abnormality, negative for malignancy. Fallopian tube, right, salpingectomy: - No significant pathologic abnormality, negative for malignancy. Fallopian tube, left, salpingectomy: - No significant pathologic abnormality, negative for malignancy. Comment: The specimen shows moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with characteristic squamous morular growth pattern,. suggestive of an endometrioid type histology. The tumor is negative for estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor. The. tumor is positive for p16, but given the endometrioid histology the significance of this is unclear. The bulk of. invasive tumor is present in the high endocervical canal. According to clinical notes, the patient had a diagnostic. endometrial biopsy in. with endometrioid adenocarcinoma (FIGO : 2). External beam radiation therapy followed. Endometrial biopsy in : returned endometrioid adenocarcinoma (FIGO 3). It is possible that while much of the. upper. corpus. tumor responded to therapy, residual adenocarcinoma in the LUS/endocervical canal region has selectively. recurred. Alternatively, the endocervical tumor location and lack of upper corpus myometrial invasion raises. the possibility of an endocervical primary tumor. Clinical correlation is advised. Clinical History: The patient is with endometrial carcinoma. Gross Description: Received is one appropriately labeled container, additionally labeled ""cervix, uterus, both ovary and tube."".

Equivocal Category for HER2 IHC results: A HER2, 2+ staining result that is interpreted as equivocal. may not indicate gene amplification. A FISH test for HER2 gene amplification will be ordered for all. HER2 IHC 2+ results. COMMENT. This assay can be used to select invasive breast cancer patients for Trastuzumab (Hereptin) therapy. (1,2). Clinical Trials have shown that Trastuzumab substantially increases the likelihood for an objective. response and overall survival for patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, regardless of. whether HER2 tumor status was determined as IHC 3+ or FISH positive. Trastuzumab added to. adjuvant chemotherapy substantially increase disease-free survival and decreases the risk of disease. recurrence by about 50% for patients with early-stage HER2 protein over-expressed or gene amplified. invasive breast cancer (3). HER2 analysis was performed on this case by immunohistochemistry utilizing the FDA approved. HercepTest (TM) test kit following the manufacturer's instructions listed in the package insert. This. assay was not modified, and adherence to all instruction and guidelines were strictly followed. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical staining characteristics is guided by published results. in the medical literature (4), information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of. staining performance within the Pathology Department. HER2 TEST VALIDATION. This HER2 immunohistochemical assay has been validated according to the recently revised. recommendations and guidelines from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force, and the. jointly issued recommendations and guidelines from ASCO and the CAP (5). 80 randomly selected. breast cancer samples were tested for HER2 by IHC as outline above and interpreted as, negative. (score 0/1+) equivocal (score 2+) and positive (score 3+) without knowledge of the previous reported. results. These cases were also blindly read using two different FISH assay as amplified or non-amplified and. the HER2/CEP17 ratios were recorded. After analyzing these results, there was 100% concordance. between the IHC and FISH results for cases that were interpreted as either positive or negative by IHC. 9 of the 80 cases were interpreted as equivocal by IHC and of these 3/9 (33%) were non-amplified by. FISH and 6/9 (66%) were found to be amplified. The Pathology Department Immunohistochemistry laboratory takes full responsibility for this tests. performance and has programs in place to regularly monitor the proficiency and the interpretation of. HER2 assays. The laboratory also participates in external quality assurance HER2 programs including. the CAP proficiency testing program. REFERENCE. 1.

TCGA-06-5859,"CLINICAL HISTORY. developed. and on. imaging has a. 3. 1 cm right heterogeneous mass involving basal ganglia, and frontal. and. temporal lobes, with central enhancement. OPERATIVE DIAGNOSES. TOC: 11 am. Right temporal mass. Operation/specimen: A: Right temporal tumor, resection. B: Right temporal tumor, excision biopsy. PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS: A and B. Brain, right frontal, biopsy and excision: 1. Glioblastoma, with leptomeningeal invasion. 2. MIB-1 proliferation index: 50%. See Microscopy Description and Comment. COMMENT. The specimen is portions of cerebrum that are slightly to heavily. infiltrated. by a glial neoplastic proliferation. The neoplastic nuclei tend to be. round,. are distributed within a dense gliofibrillary background in the solid. areas,. and have proclivity for the white matter. Focally, there is brisk. mitotic. activity (up to 20 mitoses / ten high power fields), and the MIB-1. proliferation index is high at about 50% in the more active areas. On one slide from the. there. is glial. neoplasm with tumor necrosis, microvascular cellular proliferation,. and. necrotizing vasculopathy with thrombosis. The neoplasm is a glioblastoma multiforme (WHO grade IV) . In part A the tumor is very cellular. In part B the cerebrum is. sparsely to. moderately infiltrated by the neoplasm and the glioma is present. within the. leptomeninges. PROCEDURES/ADDENDA. MGMT Promoter Methylation. Interpretation. NEGATIVE: No evidence of methylated MGMT promoter is detected. Results-Comments. Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block. H slide was examined and no microdissection was. needed. A ""very low level. amplification was detected in the first run (1 of 2 PCRs), but we were. unable. to reproduce this result in repeat PCR reaction. The amplicon level. appears to. be below our assay detection level. The housekeeping control gene. COL2A1. showed adequate amplification. Therefore, we favor the low level. positivity as. background. TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT. promoter. have been shown to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents. Assessment of. MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA. followed. by real-time PCR amplification (MethyLight) of methylated and. unmethylated DNA. sequences. The analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by. serial. dilution of methylated positive control DNA into unmethylated DNA, and. was. assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated. DNA. Factors such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the. sample, or. extensive tissue necrosis, may preclude the detection of methylated. MGMT. promoter sequences. FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results. from a. stand alone diagnostic test. This test was developed and its. performance. characteristics determined by the. laboratory as. required by CLIA. regulations. It has not been cleared or approved. for. specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) The FDA. has. determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These. results are. provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted. only in. the context of established procedures and/or diagnostic criteria. Interpretation. There is deletion at telomeric locus (D1S1612) on chromosome 1p and. telomeric. loci on chromosome 19q (two loci- D19S606, PLA2G4C) suggestive of. partial. deletion of chromosome arms of 1p and 19q. Informative loci: D1S496, D1S1612, D19S219, D19S606, PLA2G4C. Results-Comments -. Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block. DNA. extracted from a corresponding blood specimen was used as normal. reference. control. TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA. (baseline) / Tumor DNA pairs using 3 markers at both 1p and 19q. The 3. markers. are D1S548, D1S1592, and D1S552 (with D1S468, D1S1612, and. D1S496 as. backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219, D19S412, and. PLA2G4C. (with D19S606 and D19S1182 as backup) All markers are microsatellites. (2 or 4. nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a minisatellite (26 nt repeat). polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score,. amplicon size, and ease of interpretation. The backup markers are used. if the. first line markers at that chromosome arm are uninformative or. otherwise. ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each. chromosomal arm represents the typical finding in oligodendrogliomas. with 1p. and 19q deletion. FDA COMMENT: ""The above data are not to be construed as the results. from a. stand-alone diagnostic test. This test was developed and its. performance. characteristics determined by the. laboratory as. required by CLIA 1. regulations. It has not been cleared or approved. for. specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) . The FDA. has. determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These. results are. provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted. only in. the context of established procedures and/or diagnostic criteria. TECHNICAL SENSITIVITY: The presence of >15% non-neoplastic cells in. the sample. may preclude the detection of allelic loss. Interpretation. NEGATIVE - No evidence of EGFRVIII mutation is detected. Results-Comments -. TEST DESCRIPTION: Testing performed on RNA extracted from tumor. paraffin block. H slide was reviewed and no microdissection was. needed. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an attractive molecular. target. in glioblastoma because it is amplified, overexpressed, and/or mutated. in up. to 40% to 50% of patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant. III. (EGFRVIII) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR. that is. commonly expressed in glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of. glioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRVIII as defining prognostically. distinct. subgroups of glioblastomas. Additionally, the presence of EGFRVIII has. been. shown to sensitize tumors to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the. tumor. suppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from formalin. fixed,. paraffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to CDNA. The. CDNA is. then amplified using standard PCR technique for DNA templates. PCR. products. are detected by gel electrophoresis. The limit of detection of this. assay has. been determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal. cells. FDA Comment : The above data are not to be construed as the results. from. stand alone diagnostic test. This test was developed and its. performance. characteristics determined by the. laboratory as. required by CLIA. regulations. It has not been cleared or approved. for. specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) The FDA. has. determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These. results are. provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted. only in. the context of established procedures and/or diagnostic criteria. INTRA-OPERATIVE CONSULTATION. A.

Internal positive control is present. Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for HER2/neu oncoprotein over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed using the CB11 monoclonal antibody to HER2/neu. oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 0 on a scale of 0-3 (HER2 test interpreted. Working Draft. by Dr. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 0 or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered indeterminate. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with. staining intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore. submitted for FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Tumors in. this category show an excellent correlation between the results of Immunohistochemical and FISH testing, and almost always show. gene amplification. Intraoperative Consult Diagnosis.
