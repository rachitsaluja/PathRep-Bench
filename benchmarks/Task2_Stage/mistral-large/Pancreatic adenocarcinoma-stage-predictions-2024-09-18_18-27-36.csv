The pathology report provides a detailed analysis of the patient's condition. Let's break it down:

1. The report indicates that the tumor is an adenocarcinoma, a type of cancer that begins in glandular (secretory) cells. The tumor size is 4.5 cm.

2. The extent of invasion shows that the cancer has invaded the peripancreatic soft tissues and the duodenum wall. The ampulla wall is also involved.

3. Lymphatic, venous, and perineural invasions are not identified, which is a positive sign.

4. Surgical margins are negative, meaning no cancer cells are found at the edges of the tissue removed during surgery.

5. However, regional lymph nodes show metastatic adenocarcinoma (2 out of 11), with the larger metastasis being 6 mm in diameter.

6. The AJCC Stage provided in the report is pT3 pN1 pMx. Here, pT3 indicates that the primary tumor has grown into nearby tissues or organs. pN1 means that cancer has spread to 1 to 3 nearby lymph nodes. pMx means that it cannot be assessed if the cancer has spread to distant sites, as this information is not available in the pathology report.

Based on the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, the combination of pT3, pN1, and pMx corresponds to Stage IIB for pancreatic cancer. However, it's important to note that the final stage might change pending clinical review and additional information.

Therefore, the answer is -
{""stage"" : ""Stage IIB""}"
1,"## Answer
The pathology report provides detailed information about the patient's pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The report states that the tumor is moderately differentiated (Histologic Grade G2) and has invaded peripancreatic soft tissues (pT3). The report also indicates that 1 out of 23 regional lymph nodes examined are positive for metastasis (pN1). There is no mention of distant metastasis (pM) in the report.

According to the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual (7th Edition), the pT3 pN1 classification corresponds to Stage IIB for pancreatic cancer. This stage indicates that the tumor has grown into nearby tissues and organs (pT3) and has spread to nearby lymph nodes (pN1), but there is no evidence of distant metastasis (pM0).

Therefore, the answer is -
{""stage"" : ""Stage IIB""}"
2,"## Answer
The pathology report indicates that the patient has a moderate to poorly-differentiated invasive pancreatic duct carcinoma. The size of the tumor is approximately 6.0 cm, with invasion into peripancreatic adipose tissue and duodenal wall with ulceration of duodenal mucosa (pT3). The margins are positive at the uncinate process and superior and posterior pancreaticoduodenal soft tissue margins. There is also positive lymphovascular and perineural invasion. Metastatic carcinoma is present in four of eleven lymph nodes (pN1). However, the para-aortic lymph node is negative for malignancy.

The TNM staging for this case would be:
- T (Primary Tumor): T3 - the tumor has invaded beyond the pancreas into the peripancreatic tissue and duodenum.
- N (Regional Lymph Nodes): N1 - cancer has spread to 1-3 nearby lymph nodes.
- M (Distant Metastasis): M0 - there is no evidence of distant metastasis.

According to the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, the TNM staging corresponds to Stage IIB for pancreatic cancer.

Therefore, the answer is -
{""stage"" : ""Stage IIB""}"
3,"## Answer
The pathology report provides several key pieces of information that can help determine the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) stage of the cancer.

1. Tumor size: The tumor is 4 cm in greatest dimension.
2. Tumor extension: The tumor invades through the muscularis propria of the duodenum and also extends into peripancreatic fat. This corresponds to a T3 classification.
3. Lymph node involvement: Twelve lymph nodes were examined, and none were positive for malignancy. This corresponds to an N0 classification.
4. Distant metastasis: The report does not provide information on distant metastasis, so it is classified as MX.
5. Margins: The tumor is present at the pancreatic neck margin and extends to the proximal duodenal margin.
6. Perineural invasion: Perineural invasion is identified.

Based on the TNM classification, this would be classified as T3N0MX. However, the AJCC stage also takes into account the extent of the tumor and the involvement of nearby structures. In this case, the tumor has invaded the duodenum and is present at the margins, which suggests a more advanced stage.

Therefore, the answer is -
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}

Explanation for the answer:
According to the AJCC 8th edition staging for pancreatic cancer, a T3N0MX tumor corresponds to Stage IIB. However, the given options do not include Stage IIB. Therefore, the closest option would be Stage II."
4,"## Answer
The pathology report indicates that the patient has ductal adenocarcinoma, a type of pancreatic cancer. The tumor is moderately differentiated and measures approximately 3.0 cm in its maximum dimension. It is located in the head of the pancreas and is seen in the ampulla of vater, involving the mucosal surface at that location.

Perineural invasion and angiolymphatic invasion are absent. All margins (common bile duct, pancreatic duct, soft tissue, retroperitoneal margin, and pancreatic resection margin) are negative for malignancy. There is no involvement of adjacent structures apart from the ampulla of vater.

12 lymph nodes were examined and all were negative for malignancy. This suggests that there is no lymph node involvement (N0).

The tumor is confined to the pancreas and the ampulla of vater, without extension to other adjacent organs or structures, and there is no evidence of distant metastasis.

Based on the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM staging system for pancreatic cancer, the tumor can be classified as follows:
- T (tumor size and extension): The tumor is more than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension and is limited to the pancreas (T2).
- N (lymph node involvement): No regional lymph node metastasis (N0).
- M (distant metastasis): No distant metastasis (M0).

Therefore, the answer is -
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
5,"## Answer
The pathology report indicates that the patient has invasive ductal adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated, with a greatest dimension of 2.8 cm. The tumor is located in the uncinate process of the pancreas and extends beyond the pancreas to involve peripancreatic soft tissue, duodenal wall, and superior mesenteric vein. There is also evidence of angiolymphatic and perineural invasion.

The report further states that the uncinate margin is involved by carcinoma and multiple lymph nodes (2 of 19) are involved by metastatic carcinoma. The AJCC stage provided in the report is pT3 N1, which corresponds to Stage IIB according to the 7th edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual.

However, it's important to note that the involvement of the superior mesenteric vein and the presence of multiple positive lymph nodes could potentially upgrade the stage to a higher one. But based on the information provided in the report, the highest stage that can be confidently assigned is Stage IIB.

Therefore, the answer is -
{""stage"" : ""Stage IIB""}"
6,"## Answer
The pathology report provides detailed information about the patient's condition. Let's break it down:

1. The report indicates that the patient has invasive ductal adenocarcinoma, a type of cancer that begins in the milk ducts of the pancreas. The tumor size is 3.0 cm.

2. The cancer has invaded the duodenal wall, peripancreatic soft tissues, extrapancreatic common bile duct, and other adjacent organs or structures (middle celiac vein).

3. Perineural invasion, which is the spread of cancer to the nerves, is present.

4. The margins are uninvolved by invasive carcinoma, meaning that the edges of the tissue removed during surgery do not contain cancer cells.

5. No lymphvascular invasion is identified, which means the cancer has not spread to the lymphatic or blood vessels.

6. The cancer has not spread to the regional lymph nodes as no regional lymph nodes metastasis is found (0 out of 16 lymph nodes examined are involved).

7. The pathologic staging is given as pT4N0. The 'pT4' indicates that the primary tumor is large and has grown into nearby organs or structures. The 'N0' indicates that no regional lymph nodes are involved.

8. Distant metastasis is not applicable, suggesting that there is no evidence of cancer spread to distant parts of the body.

Based on the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system, the pathologic staging of pT4N0 corresponds to Stage IIB for pancreatic cancer. However, the presence of metastatic adenocarcinoma in the middle celiac vein region (F) suggests distant spread, which would upgrade the stage to IV.

Therefore, the answer is -
{""stage"" : ""Stage IV""}"
7,"## Answer
The pathology report provides several key pieces of information that can be used to determine the stage of cancer.

1. The report indicates that the tumor is a moderately to poorly differentiated ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head with infiltration of the duodenum, the peripancreatic fatty tissue, and there are perineural propagations and lymphangiosis carcinomatosis. This suggests that the tumor has grown into nearby tissues and organs (pT3).

2. The report also indicates that there is infiltration in three out of 46 lymph nodes (pN1). This suggests that the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes.

3. The report mentions small foci within the soft tissue in the vicinity of the A. and V. mesenterica superior (4.,5.). This could suggest distant metastasis, but it's not entirely clear from the report.

4. The TNM classification is given as pT3, pN1 (3/43), L1, Pn1. This corresponds to a tumor that has grown into nearby tissues and organs (T3), has spread to nearby lymph nodes (N1), and there is lymphatic invasion (L1) and perineural invasion (Pn1).

5. The grading is G3, indicating a high-grade tumor with a poor level of differentiation.

6. The resection status is RX (medial, 4.,5.), indicating that the tumor could not be completely removed and microscopic residual tumor remains.

Based on the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system for pancreatic cancer, the tumor size and extension (pT3), lymph node involvement (pN1), and potential distant metastasis (not confirmed but suggested by the soft tissue foci) would classify this cancer as at least Stage III. However, if the soft tissue foci are confirmed to be distant metastases, the cancer would be classified as Stage IV. Without confirmation of distant metastasis, it's not possible to definitively classify the cancer as Stage IV based on the information"
8,"## Answer
The pathology report indicates that the patient has invasive moderately differentiated ductal adenocarcinoma in the pancreas. The tumor is 5.0 cm in size and extends beyond the pancreas, involving peripancreatic soft tissue. However, there is no angiolymphatic invasion, perineural invasion, or tumor necrosis. All surgical resection margins are negative for tumor with a minimum tumor-free margin of 2.5 cm at the pancreatic neck margin.

The report also states that multiple (16) regional lymph nodes are negative for metastatic tumor. This suggests that there is no lymph node involvement (N0).

The AJCC staging for pancreatic cancer is based on the TNM system, where T stands for the size of the primary tumor and whether it has invaded nearby tissue, N stands for the spread to nearby lymph nodes, and M stands for distant metastasis.

In this case, the tumor is more than 4 cm in size and has extended beyond the pancreas, which corresponds to T3. There is no lymph node involvement (N0), and there is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, which corresponds to M0.

Therefore, based on the AJCC 7th edition staging system, the patient would be classified as having Stage IIB pancreatic cancer (T3N0M0). However, it's important to note that the AJCC 8th edition staging system, which is currently in use, does not have a Stage IIB for pancreatic cancer. In the 8th edition, this tumor would be classified as Stage IIA (T3N0M0).

Since the question does not specify which edition of the AJCC staging system to use, I will provide the answer based on the 7th edition, as it is mentioned in the report.

Therefore, the answer is -
{""stage"" : ""Stage IIB""}"
9,"## Answer
The pathology report provides a detailed analysis of the patient's condition. Here's how we can interpret it:

1. The report indicates that multiple lymph nodes from different locations (common hepatic artery, hepatic hilar) are negative for tumor. This is a good sign.

2. However, the head of the pancreas shows an invasive grade 3 ductal adenocarcinoma, forming a solid mass that extends beyond the pancreas and involves the peripancreatic soft tissue and duodenal submucosa. This indicates local invasion of the cancer.

3. Angiolymphatic invasion and perineural invasion are present. These are indicators of more aggressive cancer behavior.

4. The tumor necrosis is absent, which is a positive sign.

5. All surgical resection margins are negative for tumor, meaning the surgery was able to remove all the visible cancer.

6. However, 2 out of 24 regional lymph nodes are positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma. This indicates that the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes.

7. The AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) pT3N1 classification is given in the report. This corresponds to Stage IIB according to the 7th edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual for pancreatic cancer.

Therefore, the answer is -
{""stage"" : ""Stage IIB""}"
10,"## Answer
The pathology report indicates that the patient has a moderately invasive adenocarcinoma in the body of the pancreas. The cancer is invading the muscular wall of the duodenum and the common bile duct. There is evidence of fat invasion, perineural and vascular invasion. Nine lymph nodes are all positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma with extranodal extension.

The AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for pancreatic cancer is as follows:
- Stage I: The cancer is confined to the pancreas.
- Stage II: The cancer has grown outside the pancreas into nearby tissue or organs but has not spread to lymph nodes or distant sites.
- Stage III: The cancer has spread to lymph nodes near the pancreas but not to distant sites.
- Stage IV: The cancer has spread to distant sites, such as the liver, lungs, or the peritoneum (the lining of the abdominal cavity).

In this case, the cancer has spread to lymph nodes, which rules out Stage I and Stage II. However, there is no mention of distant metastasis, which rules out Stage IV. Therefore, the cancer is at Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is -
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
11,"## Answer
The pathology report provides detailed information about the patient's pancreatic cancer. The report indicates that the tumor is an invasive ductal adenocarcinoma, well differentiated, with a size of 3.7 x 3.5 x 3.5 cm. The tumor has invaded peripancreatic soft tissues, retroperitoneal soft tissue, and the extrapancreatic common bile duct. Lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, and perineural invasion are present.

The report also indicates that 10 out of 24 lymph nodes are involved by metastatic adenocarcinoma. The tumor involves the common bile duct margin and the retroperitoneal margin. The proximal and distal duodenal margins are negative for malignancy.

Based on the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM staging system for pancreatic cancer, the T stage is pT3 (tumor extends beyond the pancreas but without involvement of the celiac axis or the superior mesenteric artery), the N stage is pN2 (regional lymph nodes involved are 4-6), and the M stage is not applicable as there is no evidence of distant metastasis in the report.

Therefore, based on the AJCC 8th edition staging system, the patient would be classified as having Stage III pancreatic cancer.

{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
12,"## Answer
The pathology report provides detailed information about the cancer. Here's how we can determine the stage:

1. The primary tumor (pT) is classified as pT3, meaning the tumor extends beyond the pancreas but without involvement of the celiac axis or the superior mesenteric artery.

2. The regional lymph nodes (pN) are classified as pN1a, indicating metastasis in a single regional lymph node. The report states that out of 28 lymph nodes examined, 2 were involved.

3. The distant metastasis (pM) is classified as pMX, meaning it cannot be assessed.

4. The report also mentions the presence of venous (large vessel) invasion and lymphatic (small vessel) invasion.

According to the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, the combination of pT3, pN1a, and pMX, along with the presence of venous and lymphatic invasion, suggests that the cancer is at least Stage III. However, if distant metastasis (pM1) were confirmed, it would be Stage IV. Since pMX indicates that distant metastasis cannot be assessed, the most accurate staging based on the available information is Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is -
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
13,"## Answer
The pathology report provides detailed information about the patient's pancreatic cancer. Here's how we determine the stage:

1. Tumor Size: The tumor size is 2.8 x 2 x 1.7 cm. This is within the range for T3 tumors, which are defined as tumors that extend beyond the pancreas but without involvement of the celiac axis or the superior mesenteric artery.

2. Lymph Nodes: The report states that two out of eleven lymph nodes have metastatic adenocarcinoma (2/11). This corresponds to N1, which indicates regional lymph node metastasis.

3. Distant Metastasis: The report does not provide information about distant metastasis, so it is classified as MX.

4. Other Factors: The report also mentions that there is lympho-vascular invasion and perineural invasion present, which can indicate a more advanced stage of cancer.

According to the 7th edition of the AJCC staging system for pancreatic cancer, a tumor classified as T3, N1, MX corresponds to Stage III. This is because Stage III is defined by the presence of local invasion and regional lymph node metastasis, but no distant metastasis.

Therefore, the answer is -
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
14,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the pTNM staging for the patient's pancreatic adenocarcinoma, which is pT3, N1, R1.

- pT3 indicates that the tumor extends beyond the pancreas, but has not invaded the celiac axis or the superior mesenteric artery.
- pN1 indicates that there is regional lymph node metastasis. In this case, one out of seventeen lymph nodes examined was involved.
- R1 indicates that the resection margins are involved by invasive tumor. In this case, the uncinate and posterior retroperitoneal surface margins are involved.

According to the 7th edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, the pTNM staging corresponds to Stage III for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. This is because the tumor has extended beyond the pancreas and there is regional lymph node involvement, but there is no evidence of distant metastasis.

Therefore, the answer is -
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
15,"## Answer
The pathology report provides several key pieces of information that can be used to determine the stage of the cancer.

1. The report indicates that the patient has invasive adenocarcinoma of the pancreas with transmural involvement of the duodenum. This means that the cancer has grown through the wall of the pancreas and into the duodenum.

2. The report also notes that there is invasion of peripancreatic soft tissue and that the tumor invades the wall of the superior mesenteric vein. These findings suggest that the cancer has grown outside of the pancreas and into nearby tissues and blood vessels.

3. The report states that three of twenty-two peripancreatic nodes are positive for metastatic disease. This means that the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes.

4. The TNM staging in the report is pT3, pN1, pMX. In this system, T refers to the size of the primary tumor and its extension into nearby tissues, N refers to the spread to nearby lymph nodes, and M refers to distant metastasis. pT3 indicates that the tumor has grown outside of the pancreas and into nearby tissues. pN1 indicates that the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes. pMX means that distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

5. The report does not indicate any distant metastasis, but it does show local spread and lymph node involvement.

Based on the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system for pancreatic cancer, these findings are consistent with Stage III: The tumor has grown outside of the pancreas and into nearby tissues and blood vessels, and it has spread to nearby lymph nodes, but there is no evidence of distant metastasis.

Therefore, the answer is -
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
16,"## Answer
The pathology report provides detailed information about the patient's condition. Let's break it down:

1. The diagnosis indicates that the patient has invasive moderately-differentiated ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.

2. The Synoptic Report provides the TNM classification:
   - The primary tumor (pT) is classified as pT3, meaning the tumor extends beyond the pancreas but without involvement of the celiac axis or the superior mesenteric artery.
   - The regional lymph nodes (pN) are classified as pN0, indicating no regional lymph node metastasis.
   - The report does not provide information on distant metastasis (M), but since no other sites are mentioned, we can assume it's M0.

3. However, the report mentions perineural invasion involving the groove and partial resected wall of the superior mesenteric vein with a positive pancreatic uncinate margin. This suggests local spread beyond the primary site, but it's not considered distant metastasis.

Based on the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system for pancreatic cancer, these findings correspond to:

- T3 (Tumor extends beyond the pancreas but without involvement of the celiac axis or the superior mesenteric artery)
- N0 (No regional lymph node metastasis)
- M0 (No distant metastasis)

Therefore, the answer is -
{""stage"" : ""Stage IIB""}

The reason it's Stage IIB and not Stage IIA is because of the positive margin (R1) indicated in the report, which upstages the cancer from IIA to IIB according to the AJCC staging system."
17,"## Answer
The pathology report indicates that the patient has ductal adenocarcinoma, a mucinous variant, in the pancreas. The tumor is more than 2 cm in greatest dimension and is limited to the pancreas (pT2). However, it has invaded the duodenal wall and one peripancreatic lymph node has metastatic carcinoma present (pN1). The common bile duct margin is positive for invasive carcinoma. Perineural invasion is present, but lymph-vascular invasion is not identified.

The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging for pancreatic cancer is as follows:
- Stage I: The cancer is only in the pancreas.
- Stage II: The cancer has grown outside the pancreas into nearby tissue or organs, but has not spread to nearby lymph nodes.
- Stage III: The cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes or major blood vessels near the pancreas.
- Stage IV: The cancer has spread to distant organs, such as the liver or lungs.

Based on the information provided, the cancer has spread to a nearby lymph node (pN1) and has invaded the duodenal wall, but there is no evidence of distant metastasis. Therefore, the answer is -
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
18,"## Answer
The pathology report provides detailed information about the patient's pancreatic cancer. The report states that the tumor size is 6 X 4.5 X 3.4 cm and it extends beyond the pancreas but without involvement of the celiac axis or the superior mesenteric artery, which corresponds to pT3 in the TNM staging system. The report also indicates that there is no regional lymph node metastasis (pN0) and no distant metastasis (pM0).

The report also mentions that the retroperitoneal margin of resection is positive for adenocarcinoma, which could suggest a more advanced stage. However, the final TNM staging provided in the report is pT3N0M0, which corresponds to Stage IIA according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system.

Therefore, the answer is -
{""stage"" : ""Stage IIA""}"
19,"## Answer
The pathology report provides detailed information about the patient's pancreatic cancer. The report states that the patient has a pancreatic invasive well-differentiated ductal adenocarcinoma that is approximately 3.5 cm in size and involves the common bile duct, peripancreatic fat, and tissue around the superior mesenteric vein. The report also indicates that there is extensive perineural invasion and that five of ten peripancreatic lymph nodes are positive for metastatic carcinoma with extranodal extension. The resection margin of peripancreatic fat is < 0.1 cm from the tumor, and the pancreatic distal resection margin is involved by carcinoma. The AJCC staging provided in the report is pT4N1Mx.

According to the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, the pT4N1Mx staging corresponds to Stage III pancreatic cancer. This stage is characterized by a tumor that has invaded nearby large blood vessels or nerves and has spread to nearby lymph nodes but has not spread to distant sites.

Therefore, the answer is -
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
20,"## Answer
The pathology report provides detailed information about the patient's condition. Let's break it down:

1. The report indicates that the patient has ductal adenocarcinoma, a type of pancreatic cancer that is moderately differentiated (Histologic Grade: G2).

2. The tumor size is 2.8 cm in greatest dimension (Tumor Size: Greatest Dimension: 2.8 cm).

3. The tumor has extended beyond the pancreas and is invading the duodenal wall (Microscopic Tumor Extension: Tumor Invades duodenal wall) but does not involve the celiac axis or the superior mesenteric artery (Primary Tumor: pT3).

4. There is evidence of regional lymph node metastasis (Regional Lymph Nodes; pN1), with 1 out of 12 lymph nodes involved.

5. There is no mention of distant metastasis (MX), but it's important to note that MX means that the distant metastasis cannot be assessed based on the information available.

Based on the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM staging system for pancreatic cancer, the patient's cancer would be classified as Stage III. This is because the tumor has extended beyond the pancreas (T3), there is regional lymph node involvement (N1), and while distant metastasis cannot be assessed (MX), there is no evidence of it in the provided report.

Therefore, the answer is -
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
21,"## Answer
The pathology report indicates that the patient has invasive moderately differentiated ductal adenocarcinoma in the pancreatic head. The tumor extends beyond the pancreas to involve the peripancreatic soft tissue and shows perineural invasion. The uncinate margin tissue shows metastatic adenocarcinoma to a lymph node with soft tissue extension. The tumor is 0.1 cm from the portal vein groove. Multiple (7 of 15) regional lymph nodes are involved by metastatic adenocarcinoma.

The AJCC stage provided in the report is pT3N1 (7th edition). According to the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual (7th edition), pT3 indicates that the tumor extends beyond the pancreas but without involvement of the celiac axis or the superior mesenteric artery. pN1 indicates that there is regional lymph node metastasis.

However, the AJCC stage provided in the report does not include the 'M' category, which indicates the presence or absence of distant metastasis. In this case, there is no mention of distant metastasis in the provided report.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the pathology report, the cancer would be staged as Stage III.

{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
22,"The pathology report provides detailed information about the patient's condition. Let's break it down:

1. The report indicates that the patient has a mucinous neoplasm within the main pancreatic duct, which is consistent with an intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN).

2. The neoplasm has produced abundant mucin that has extravasated into the surrounding parenchyma.

3. There are areas of invasive glands within the pancreatic stroma, and focal areas are suspicious for perineural invasion.

4. One lymph node shows small glands consistent with tumor.

5. The pTNM stage is given as pT3 N1. The T3 indicates that the tumor has extended beyond the pancreas into nearby tissues or organs (in this case, the duodenal wall). The N1 indicates that the cancer has spread to 1-3 nearby lymph nodes.

6. The report does not mention any distant metastases (M0).

The AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for pancreatic cancer is as follows:

- Stage I: The cancer is confined to the pancreas.
- Stage II: The cancer has grown outside the pancreas and may have grown into nearby blood vessels or nerves. It has not spread to lymph nodes or distant sites.
- Stage III: The cancer has spread to lymph nodes near the pancreas but not to distant sites.
- Stage IV: The cancer has spread to distant sites, such as the liver or lungs.

Based on the information provided in the pathology report, the cancer has extended beyond the pancreas into nearby tissues (T3) and has spread to 1-3 nearby lymph nodes (N1), but there is no mention of distant metastases. Therefore, the answer is -
