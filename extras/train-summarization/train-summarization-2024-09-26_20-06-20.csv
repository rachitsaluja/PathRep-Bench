Overall, the findings suggest localized disease without lymphatic spread."
7612,"The pathology report indicates a partial resection of the transverse colon revealing a moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with a histopathological differentiation grade of G2-3. The tumor shows erosions on the inner surface, evidence of carcinomatous lymphangitis, and infiltration into the muscularis layer of the colon wall, but no tumor was found in the examined lymph nodes (0/15). The tumor is classified as pT2, pNO (015), Mx, L1, R0, with a diagnosis code of ICDO-DA-M 8140/3."
7613,"The pathology report indicates a diagnosis of dedifferentiated liposarcoma arising from a well-differentiated liposarcoma in the right retroperitoneum, with the dedifferentiated component comprising over 98% of the mass and showing high-grade spindle and pleomorphic characteristics. The tumor, measuring 10.8 cm, involves the colonic wall and exhibits necrosis, while a separate well-differentiated liposarcoma measuring 6 cm is also present, affecting the spermatic cord. Surgical resection margins are uninvolved, and immunohistochemical stains for CDK4 and MDM2 are positive in the tumor cells."
7614,"The pathology report indicates a diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma with Xp11.2 translocation in the right kidney, characterized by a large tumor measuring 17.0 cm and showing necrosis, but without lymphovascular invasion. The adrenal gland shows focal cortical nodular hyperplasia, and the paracaval lymph node and hernia sac specimens reveal no evidence of tumor. Cytogenetic analysis confirms an abnormal karyotype with a balanced translocation involving chromosomes X and 1, associated with the development of renal cell carcinoma."
7615,"The pathology report indicates the presence of metastatic carcinoma in one of fifteen right pelvic lymph nodes, while three left pelvic lymph nodes show no evidence of neoplasia. A radical prostatectomy reveals invasive poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with a Gleason score of 8, involving both lobes of the prostate and showing established extracapsular extension, with involvement of the left seminal vesicle. The surgical margins are free of carcinoma, and perineural invasion is noted, with a pathologic TNM stage of pT3b N1 MX."
7616,"The pathology report indicates a diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme (WHO Grade IV) in the left frontal lobe of the brain, confirmed by multiple biopsy specimens. Additional findings include infiltrating gliomas demonstrating both oligodendroglial and astrocytic differentiation, along with chromosomal losses in 1p and 19q. The report includes various specimens labeled as ""permanent edge,"" ""permanent core,"" and ""permanent white matter,"" all consistent with malignant glioma."
7617,"The pathology report indicates a diagnosis of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma in the right upper lobe of the lung, measuring 3.5 cm, with uninvolved surgical margins and no evidence of metastasis in five examined lymph nodes. Additional lymph node resections (R4 and Level VII) also showed no evidence of metastasis. Overall, the findings suggest a localized tumor without regional or distant spread at the time of evaluation."
