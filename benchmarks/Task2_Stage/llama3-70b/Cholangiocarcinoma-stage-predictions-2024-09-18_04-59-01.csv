Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor is located in the right hepatic lobe, and the tumor size is 6.2 cm in largest dimension (gross measurement).
2. The tumor growth pattern is mass-forming, and vascular invasion is present, with tumor invasion into portal vein branches and into vena cava.
3. Perineural invasion is identified in specimen D.
4. Invasion of liver capsule is present, but the tumor does not invade through the liver capsule.
5. The parenchymal resection margins are positive for carcinoma.
6. The vascular resection margins are negative for carcinoma.
7. One pericystic lymph node is negative for metastatic carcinoma (0/1).

Based on the AJCC staging manual (7th edition), the tumor is classified as pT2a (tumor size > 5 cm) and pNO (no regional lymph node metastasis).

Considering the presence of vascular invasion and positive parenchymal resection margins, the tumor is likely to have a higher stage.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
1,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions that the tumor is a cholangiocarcinoma, which is a type of cancer that originates in the bile ducts.
2. The tumor size is reported as 5.1 cm, which is a significant size.
3. The report mentions that the tumor is multifocal, meaning there are multiple tumor foci present in the liver.
4. The tumor is reported to be present at the inked resection margin, which indicates that the tumor is close to the edge of the surgical resection.
5. The report also mentions that the tumor is present at the non-inked cauterized margin, which further supports the idea that the tumor is close to the edge of the surgical resection.
6. The lymph node status is reported as negative, with only one lymph node examined.
7. The AJCC stage is reported as pT3aN0, which indicates that the tumor is classified as T3 (tumor invades adjacent organs or structures) and N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis).

Based on the above information, we can conclude that the AJCC stage of the cancer is Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
2,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor (pT) is classified as pT2b, which means there are multiple tumors, with or without vascular invasion.
2. The tumor size is 3.3 cm, and it focally extends to within 0.1 cm of the parenchymal margin of resection.
3. The tumor superficially invades into the adventitia of a large caliber vein in the hepatic parenchyma, but the lumen of the vein is free of carcinoma.
4. The tumor abuts the capsule of the liver.
5. There is no involvement of the bile duct margin, and the vascular margin is uninvolved by invasive carcinoma.
6. The regional lymph nodes (pN) cannot be assessed, as no nodes were examined.
7. There is no distant metastasis (pM).

Based on the above information, the AJCC stage of the cancer is Stage III. The tumor is classified as pT2b, which corresponds to Stage II, but the tumor also invades the adventitia of a large caliber vein, which upstages it to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
3,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the Cancer:

1. The diagnosis is intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, which is a type of liver cancer.
2. The tumor size is 6.8 X 6.6 X 5.8 cm, which is a significant size, but we need to consider other factors to determine the stage.
3. The tumor extends to 0.3 cm from the surgical resection margin, which means it has not invaded the resection margin (R0 resection).
4. There is no mention of lymph node involvement or distant metastases in the report.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, the tumor size and extension to the resection margin are important factors in determining the stage.

Based on the report, the tumor size is >5 cm, which corresponds to T2. The tumor has not invaded the resection margin, and there is no lymph node involvement or distant metastases.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage II}"
4,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor location is in the liver, specifically in Segments 1-4 and a portion of 8, with a size of 10 cm (gross measurement).
2. The tumor is poorly differentiated and has a mass-forming growth pattern.
3. Vascular invasion and perineural invasion are present, which are important factors in determining the T stage.
4. The tumor abuts the capsule but does not extend through it, which suggests that the tumor has not breached the liver capsule.
5. The margins are negative for malignancy but are close, with the tumor being 1 mm from the blue inked surgical margin, 1 mm from the green inked soft tissue margin, and 8 mm from the red inked margin.
6. There is no lymph node involvement, as none were received.
7. The AJCC Pathologic TNM Stage is reported as pT3 pNX, which indicates a T3 tumor (tumor more than 5 cm in greatest dimension) with unknown lymph node status.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC Stage as follows:

* T stage: T3 (tumor more than 5 cm in greatest dimension)
* N stage: NX (unknown lymph node status)
* M stage: M0 (no distant metastases mentioned in the report)

According to the AJCC Staging Manual, a T3 tumor with unknown lymph node status and no distant metastases corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
