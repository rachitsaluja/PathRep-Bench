To determine the AJCC stage of the renal cell carcinoma from the pathology report, we need to consider several key factors:

1. **Tumor Size**: The report states that the greatest diameter of the tumor is 4.0 cm.

2. **Local Invasion**: The report indicates that there is no local invasion identified.

3. **Renal Vein Invasion**: The report states that renal vein invasion is not identified.

4. **Surgical Margins**: The surgical margins are free of tumor, indicating no spread beyond the kidney.

5. **Lymph Nodes and Adrenal Gland**: Neither lymph nodes nor adrenal gland involvement is identified.

6. **Pathological Staging (pT)**: The report mentions ""pT1 Tumor <= 7.0 cm in greatest dimension limited to the kidney.""

Based on the AJCC staging system for renal cell carcinoma:
- **Stage I** is characterized by a tumor that is 7 cm or less in greatest dimension and limited to the kidney (pT1).
- **Stage II** involves a tumor greater than 7 cm but still limited to the kidney (pT2).
- **Stage III** and **Stage IV** involve more extensive local invasion, lymph node involvement, or distant metastasis, none of which are present in this case.

Given that the tumor is 4.0 cm, limited to the kidney, and there is no evidence of local invasion, renal vein invasion, or lymph node involvement, the cancer fits the criteria for Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
1,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information:

1. **Tumor Size and Location**: The renal cell carcinoma is 8.2 cm in dimension and confined to the kidney. It does not involve the peripelvic fat, ureter, or renal vessels, and the surgical margins are negative for malignancy.

2. **Lymphovascular Invasion and Lymph Nodes**: There is no lymphovascular invasion, and no lymph nodes were submitted for evaluation.

3. **AJCC Classification**: The report specifies the AJCC classification as T2NXMX.

Based on the AJCC staging system for renal cell carcinoma:

- **T2** indicates a tumor size greater than 7 cm but limited to the kidney.
- **NX** means that the regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed.
- **MX** means that distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Given the T2 classification and the absence of lymph node involvement or distant metastasis information, the cancer is confined to the kidney and is larger than 7 cm, which corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
2,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information:

- The tumor is a renal cell carcinoma, conventional (clear cell) type, with a size of 9.7 cm.
- The tumor does not extend beyond Gerota's fascia.
- All examined surgical resection margins are free of tumor.
- There is no evidence of angiolymphatic invasion.
- The TNM pathologic stage is pT2 NX MX.
- The histologic grade is Fuhrman nuclear grade 3 of 4.

According to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for renal cell carcinoma:

- **T2** indicates a tumor that is more than 7 cm in greatest dimension but limited to the kidney.
- **NX** means that the regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed.
- **MX** means that distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

For renal cell carcinoma, Stage II is defined as T2, N0, M0. Although the N and M categories are not assessed (NX and MX), the T2 classification is consistent with Stage II, assuming no lymph node involvement or distant metastasis, which is typically the case when NX and MX are used.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
3,"## Answer
The pathology report provides several key pieces of information that are crucial for staging the renal cell carcinoma according to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system:

1. **Tumor Type and Grade**: The tumor is identified as renal cell carcinoma, conventional (clear cell) type, with a Fuhrman Nuclear Grade of II/IV.

2. **Tumor Size**: The greatest diameter of the tumor is 2.7 cm.

3. **Local Invasion**: There is no local invasion identified, meaning the tumor is confined to the kidney.

4. **Renal Vein Invasion**: Not identified, indicating no spread to the renal vein.

5. **Surgical Margins**: The margins are free of tumor, suggesting complete resection of the tumor.

6. **Staging Information**: The report explicitly states ""pT1 Tumor <= 7.0 cm in greatest dimension limited to the kidney.""

Based on the AJCC staging criteria for renal cell carcinoma:
- **Stage I**: Tumor is 7 cm or less in greatest dimension and limited to the kidney (pT1).
- **Stage II**: Tumor is more than 7 cm in greatest dimension and limited to the kidney (pT2).
- **Stage III**: Tumor extends into major veins or perinephric tissues but not beyond Gerota's fascia and not involving the ipsilateral adrenal gland (pT3).
- **Stage IV**: Tumor invades beyond Gerota's fascia or involves the ipsilateral adrenal gland (pT4), or there is distant metastasis.

Given that the tumor is 2.7 cm, confined to the kidney, and there is no evidence of local invasion or renal vein invasion, the appropriate stage is Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
4,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging:

1. **Tumor Size and Extent**: The tumor is 16 cm in greatest dimension and extends into the renal vein and invades the perinephric fat. This indicates a significant local extension of the tumor.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The aorto caval lymph nodes are benign, indicating no regional lymph node metastasis (pN0).

3. **Distant Metastasis**: Distant metastasis cannot be assessed (pMX), but there is no evidence provided in the report of distant metastasis.

4. **Pathologic Stage**: The report explicitly states the pathologic stage as pT3b pN0 pMX. According to the AJCC staging system for renal cell carcinoma:
   - **pT3b**: The tumor extends into major veins or perinephric tissues but not into the ipsilateral adrenal gland and not beyond Gerota's fascia.
   - **pN0**: No regional lymph node metastasis.
   - **pMX**: Distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Based on the AJCC staging system, a pT3b N0 M0 classification corresponds to Stage III renal cell carcinoma.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
5,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to consider the pathologic TNM classification provided in the pathology report:

1. **Tumor Size and Extent (T):** The report states ""pT1b,"" which indicates that the tumor is more than 4 cm but not more than 7 cm in greatest dimension and is limited to the kidney. This corresponds to T1b in the AJCC staging system.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):** The report indicates ""pNX,"" meaning that the regional lymph nodes were not assessed. However, the absence of lymph node involvement is often assumed in the absence of evidence to the contrary, especially when no lymph nodes are examined.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** The report states ""pMX,"" indicating that distant metastasis was not assessed. However, there is no mention of metastasis elsewhere in the report, suggesting no evidence of distant spread.

4. **Margins and Other Factors:** The report mentions that the surgical margins are free of neoplasm (R0), and there is no angiolymphatic invasion, which supports a lower stage.

Based on the TNM classification provided (pT1b, pNX, pMX) and the additional information that the tumor is confined to the kidney with no lymphovascular invasion or metastasis, the cancer is best classified as Stage I according to the AJCC staging system.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
6,"## Answer
The pathology report indicates the following key findings:

1. **Tumor Size and Location**: The renal cell carcinoma is 6.8 cm in greatest diameter and extends through the renal capsule but is confined within Gerota's fascia. This suggests a T2 classification, as T2 tumors are more than 7 cm in greatest dimension but limited to the kidney.

2. **Renal Vein Invasion**: There is invasion of the renal vein, which is a significant finding. According to the AJCC staging system, renal vein invasion classifies the tumor as at least T3a.

3. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The para-aortic lymph node is benign, and no lymph nodes are identified in the perinephric adipose tissue. This suggests N0, meaning no regional lymph node metastasis.

4. **Distant Metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, and the spleen and right renal artery are free of tumor. This suggests M0, meaning no distant metastasis.

Based on these findings, the tumor is classified as T3a N0 M0. According to the AJCC staging system for renal cell carcinoma, this corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
7,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging the cancer according to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) guidelines:

1. **Primary Tumor (pT):** The tumor is classified as pT1b, which indicates that the tumor is more than 4 cm but not more than 7 cm in greatest dimension and is limited to the kidney.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN):** The status is pNX, meaning the regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed.

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM):** The status is pMX, meaning distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

4. **Margins:** The surgical margins are uninvolved by invasive carcinoma, indicating no spread beyond the kidney.

5. **Venous and Lymphatic Invasion:** Both are absent, suggesting no evidence of spread through blood vessels or lymphatics.

Based on the AJCC staging system for renal cell carcinoma:
- **Stage I** is defined as a tumor that is 7 cm or less in greatest dimension and limited to the kidney (pT1), with no lymph node involvement (pN0) and no distant metastasis (pM0).
- **Stage II** involves a tumor more than 7 cm in greatest dimension but still limited to the kidney (pT2), with no lymph node involvement (pN0) and no distant metastasis (pM0).
- **Stage III** and **Stage IV** involve more advanced disease with lymph node involvement, invasion into major veins, or distant metastasis.

Given that the tumor is 6.5 cm, limited to the kidney, and there is no evidence of lymph node involvement or distant metastasis (though they cannot be assessed), the most appropriate stage based on the available information is **Stage I**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"

To determine the AJCC stage of the renal cell carcinoma described in the pathology report, we need to consider the tumor size, extent of invasion, and presence of metastasis.

1. **Tumor Size and Extent**: The tumor is 8.0 cm in maximum dimension and is confined to the kidney. It does not invade the perinephric adipose tissue, renal sinus, renal vein, or extend to Gerota's fascia. The adrenal gland is free of tumor, and there are no lymph nodes identified in the hilum of the kidney.

2. **AJCC Staging for Renal Cell Carcinoma**:
   - **Stage I**: Tumor is 7 cm or less in greatest dimension and limited to the kidney.
   - **Stage II**: Tumor is more than 7 cm in greatest dimension and limited to the kidney.
   - **Stage III**: Tumor extends into major veins or perinephric tissues but not beyond Gerota's fascia, or involves a single regional lymph node.
   - **Stage IV**: Tumor invades beyond Gerota's fascia or involves multiple regional lymph nodes or distant metastasis.

3. **Analysis**: The tumor is 8.0 cm, which is more than 7 cm, and it is confined to the kidney without any invasion into major veins, perinephric tissues, or beyond Gerota's fascia. There is no lymph node involvement or distant metastasis.

Based on the above information, the tumor fits the criteria for Stage II, as it is more than 7 cm but confined to the kidney.

Therefore, the answer is -

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
21,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information:

1. **Tumor Size and Type**: The renal cell carcinoma is 4.8 cm in size and is of the conventional (clear cell) type.

2. **Tumor Extension**: The tumor extends into the perirenal adipose tissue and renal sinus but does not involve Gerota's fascia.

3. **Vascular Involvement**: There is a renal cell carcinoma thrombus present in and occluding a large renal vein. Additionally, there is a thrombus in the inferior vena cava comprised of metastatic renal cell carcinoma.

4. **Margins**: The ureter, vascular, and perirenal soft tissue resection margins are free of tumor.

5. **Pathologic Stage**: The pathologic stage is given as T3c; NX; MX.

6. **Adrenal Gland**: The right adrenal gland is benign with no evidence of malignancy.

The AJCC staging for renal cell carcinoma is based on the TNM system:

- **T3c** indicates that the tumor extends into major veins or perinephric tissues but not into the ipsilateral adrenal gland and not beyond Gerota's fascia. Specifically, T3c involves the tumor thrombus extending into the inferior vena cava above the diaphragm or invading the wall of the vena cava.

- **NX** means that the regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed.

- **MX** means that distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Given the T3c classification, the tumor has extended into major veins, specifically the inferior vena cava, which is characteristic of Stage III renal cell carcinoma. However, the presence of a thrombus in the inferior vena cava comprised of metastatic renal cell carcinoma suggests distant spread, which aligns with Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IV""}"

3. **TNM Classification**: The report specifies T1, NX, MX, G3.

According to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for renal cell carcinoma:

- **T1** indicates a tumor that is 7 cm or less in greatest dimension and limited to the kidney.
- **NX** means that the regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed.
- **MX** means that distant metastasis cannot be assessed.
- **G3** refers to the Fuhrman nuclear grade, which is not directly used in staging but indicates a higher grade tumor.

Given that the tumor is 4.0 cm and confined to the kidney (T1), with no evidence of lymph node involvement or distant metastasis provided (NX, MX), this corresponds to Stage I renal cell carcinoma.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
25,"## Answer
The pathology report provides several key pieces of information that are crucial for staging the renal cell carcinoma according to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system:

1. **Tumor Size**: The tumor measures 3.8 cm in maximum dimension. According to the AJCC staging system for renal cell carcinoma, a tumor that is 7 cm or less and limited to the kidney is classified as T1.

2. **Tumor Invasion**: The report mentions that the tumor is confined within the kidney and does not directly invade the renal sinus adipose tissue, although it is pushing into it. There is no mention of invasion into major veins, adrenal gland, or beyond Gerota's fascia, which would be necessary for a higher T classification (T3 or T4).

3. **Margins and Other Structures**: The vascular, ureteral, and soft tissue margins of resection are free of tumor, and the adrenal gland shows no tumor presence. This suggests that the tumor has not spread beyond the kidney.

4. **Lymph Nodes and Metastasis**: There is no mention of lymph node involvement or distant metastasis in the report, which would be necessary for N1 or M1 classification.

Based on the information provided, the tumor is classified as T1 (tumor 7 cm or less, limited to the kidney), N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis), and M0 (no distant metastasis). This corresponds to Stage I renal cell carcinoma.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
26,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging the renal cell carcinoma:

1. **Tumor Size**: The tumor is 5.1 cm in size.
2. **Tumor Confined to Kidney**: The tumor is confined to the kidney without extrarenal extension.
3. **No Involvement of Renal Pelvis or Renal Vein**: The tumor does not involve the renal pelvis or the renal vein.
4. **No Lymphovascular Invasion**: No lymphovascular space invasion is identified.
5. **No Lymph Nodes Identified**: There are no lymph nodes identified within the adipose tissue.
6. **Pathologic Stage**: The report specifies the pathologic stage as pT1B pNX pMX.

According to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for renal cell carcinoma:
- **T1b**: Tumor more than 4 cm but not more than 7 cm in greatest dimension, limited to the kidney.
- **N0**: No regional lymph node metastasis (pNX indicates that regional lymph nodes were not assessed).
- **M0**: No distant metastasis (pMX indicates that distant metastasis was not assessed).

Given the information:
- The tumor is classified as T1b because it is more than 4 cm but not more than 7 cm and confined to the kidney.
- The absence of lymph node involvement and distant metastasis assessment (pNX and pMX) suggests that there is no evidence of spread beyond the kidney.

Based on the AJCC staging criteria, a T1b tumor with no evidence of nodal or distant metastasis corresponds to **Stage I** renal cell carcinoma.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
27,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the renal cell carcinoma described in the pathology report, we need to consider the tumor size, extent, and involvement of lymph nodes or distant metastasis.

1. **Tumor Size and Extent (T):** 
   - The tumor is described as a 2.5 x 2.5 x 2.5 cm mass located in the mid kidney.
   - The tumor is confined to the kidney, does not involve the collecting system, and the renal vein is free of tumor.
   - The surgical margins are negative, indicating no spread beyond the kidney.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N):**
   - No renal hilar lymph nodes are identified, suggesting no lymph node involvement.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):**
   - There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report.

According to the AJCC staging system for renal cell carcinoma:
- **Stage I** is characterized by a tumor that is 7 cm or less in greatest dimension and confined to the kidney (T1, N0, M0).
- **Stage II** involves a tumor greater than 7 cm but still confined to the kidney (T2, N0, M0).
- **Stage III** and **Stage IV** involve more advanced local spread, lymph node involvement, or distant metastasis.

Given that the tumor is 2.5 cm, confined to the kidney, with no lymph node involvement or distant metastasis, it fits the criteria for **Stage I**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
28,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information:

1. **Tumor Size and Location**: The renal cell carcinoma is 9.0 cm in size, located in the inferior renal pole, and confined to the kidney. This indicates a T2 classification, as T2 tumors are more than 7 cm in greatest dimension but limited to the kidney.

2. **Margins**: The circumferential, ureteral, and vascular margins are negative for tumor, indicating no local spread beyond the kidney.

3. **Lymph Nodes**: Three inter-aortal lymph nodes were examined and found to be negative for tumor involvement (0/3), indicating N0 classification.

4. **Metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis, so we assume Mx (distant metastasis cannot be assessed) or M0 (no distant metastasis).

Based on the AJCC staging system for renal cell carcinoma:
- T2 indicates a tumor more than 7 cm but limited to the kidney.
- N0 indicates no regional lymph node involvement.
- Mx/M0 indicates no distant metastasis or metastasis cannot be assessed.

30,"## Answer
The pathology report indicates the following key findings:

1. The primary tumor in the kidney is a poorly differentiated renal cell carcinoma measuring 7.9x7.2x4.0 cm.
2. The tumor penetrates the renal capsule and extends into the perinephric fat, which corresponds to a T3a classification.
3. The renal artery, renal vein, and ureteral margins are free of tumor, and there is no angiolymphatic or perineural invasion.
4. The pathologic TNM stage is given as T3a NX MX, indicating that the primary tumor is T3a, regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed (NX), and distant metastasis cannot be assessed (MX).
5. There is evidence of metastatic clear cell carcinoma in the stomach and left shoulder, consistent with renal origin.

The presence of metastatic disease (as indicated by the stomach and shoulder lesions) confirms that the cancer has spread beyond the primary site. According to the AJCC staging system, the presence of distant metastasis classifies the cancer as Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IV""}"

- The tumor is a renal cell carcinoma, clear cell type, with a Fuhrman grade of 4.
- The tumor measures 13.2 cm in largest diameter.
- The carcinoma invades into, but not through, the renal capsule.
- All surgical resection margins are free of carcinoma.
- The adrenal gland is present and shows no neoplasia.
- The pTNM stage is given as pT2, NX, MX.

According to the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system for renal cell carcinoma:

- **T2** indicates a tumor that is more than 7 cm in greatest dimension, limited to the kidney.
- **NX** means that the regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed.
- **MX** means that distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

For kidney cancer, Stage II is defined as T2, N0, M0, which corresponds to a tumor more than 7 cm but limited to the kidney, with no regional lymph node involvement and no distant metastasis. Although the lymph node and metastasis status are not assessed (NX, MX), the primary tumor size and confinement to the kidney (T2) suggest Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
33,"## Answer
The pathology report provides the following key information for staging:

1. **Tumor Size and Extent**: The tumor is 16 cm in greatest dimension. It invades the renal sinus soft tissues but is confined to the kidney without extracapsular extension. The tumor involves the renal vein.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: Metastatic renal cell carcinoma is present in one of fifteen lymph nodes (1/15).

3. **AJCC Staging Provided**: The report mentions AJCC staging as pT3a pN1.

- **pT3a**: This indicates that the tumor has invaded the renal vein or its segmental branches, or invades perirenal and/or renal sinus fat but not beyond Gerota's fascia. The tumor size and invasion into the renal sinus soft tissues and renal vein align with this classification.

- **pN1**: This indicates metastasis in regional lymph nodes, which is confirmed by the presence of metastatic carcinoma in one lymph node.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system for renal cell carcinoma:
- Stage III includes pT3a with any N (N0 or N1) and M0 (no distant metastasis).

- Stage IV would require either pT4 (tumor invades beyond Gerota's fascia) or any T with N2 (more extensive lymph node involvement) or M1 (distant metastasis).

Given the information:
- The tumor is classified as pT3a due to renal vein involvement.
- There is lymph node involvement (pN1), but no mention of distant metastasis (M0 is assumed).

Therefore, the cancer is classified as Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
34,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the renal cell carcinoma described in the pathology report, we need to consider the size of the tumor, the involvement of lymph nodes, and the presence of metastasis.

1. **Tumor Size and Characteristics**: The report describes a ""Left kidney tumor"" that is a renal cell carcinoma, clear cell type, with a Furhman nuclear grade II. The size of the tumor is given as 2.4 x 2.6 x 1.8 cm. According to the AJCC staging system for renal cell carcinoma, a tumor that is 7 cm or less in greatest dimension and confined to the kidney is classified as T1.

2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: The report does not mention any lymph node involvement. In the absence of lymph node involvement, we assume N0.

3. **Metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so we assume M0.

Based on the above information:
- T1 (tumor size ≤ 7 cm and confined to the kidney)
- N0 (no regional lymph node involvement)
- M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC staging system, a T1, N0, M0 renal cell carcinoma is classified as Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
35,"## Answer
The pathology report provides several key pieces of information that are crucial for determining the AJCC stage of the renal cell carcinoma:

- **Stage IV**: Tumor invades beyond Gerota's fascia (pT4) or involves more than one regional lymph node or has distant metastasis.

Given that the tumor is classified as pT3b due to its extension into the renal vein(s) or vena cava below the diaphragm, and there is no lymph node involvement or distant metastasis, the cancer is best classified as Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
36,"## Answer
To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to consider the TNM classification provided in the pathology report:

1. **Primary Tumor (T):** The report states ""pT1b: Tumor more than 4 cm but not more than 7 cm in greatest dimension, limited to the kidney."" According to AJCC staging, T1b indicates a tumor that is more than 4 cm but not more than 7 cm and is confined to the kidney.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):** The report states ""pN0: No regional lymph node metastasis."" This indicates that there is no evidence of cancer in the regional lymph nodes.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** The report states ""pMX: Cannot be assessed."" However, for staging purposes, if there is no evidence of distant metastasis, it is typically considered as M0 unless otherwise specified.

Based on the TNM classification:
- T1b
- N0
- M0 (assumed due to lack of evidence of metastasis)

According to the AJCC staging system for renal cell carcinoma:
- Stage I is defined as T1, N0, M0.

Therefore, the cancer is classified as Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is -

- **T2a** indicates a tumor size greater than 7 cm but less than or equal to 10 cm, limited to the kidney.
- **N0** indicates no regional lymph node metastasis.

Based on this information, Tumor #1 is classified as Stage II renal cell carcinoma, as Stage II corresponds to T2 (tumor >7 cm but ≤10 cm, limited to the kidney) and N0 (no regional lymph node involvement).

Tumor #2 is a papillary renal cell carcinoma, type 1, with a size of 0.8 cm and is staged as pT1a pN0. However, the staging of the primary tumor (Tumor #1) is typically used to determine the overall stage of the cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
