1. **Breast Findings**: The report indicates the presence of fibrocystic mastopathy and ductal hyperplasia, along with extensive lobular neoplasia and a well-differentiated intraductal breast carcinoma (DCIS grade 1) transitioning to invasive ductal carcinoma. The fact that the DCIS is well-differentiated and the axillary lymph nodes are tumor-free is a positive sign, suggesting a lower risk of aggressive disease progression.

2. **Rectal Findings**: The report also mentions moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in the rectum with lymphatic invasion but no local lymph node metastases. The absence of lymph node involvement is crucial as it typically indicates a better prognosis. However, lymphatic invasion can be a concerning factor, but it does not necessarily equate to a poor outcome if there are no metastases.

3. **Liver Findings**: The hepatic wedge excision shows non-active cirrhosis with focal steatosis, which indicates liver damage but does not suggest active metastatic disease from the rectal carcinoma.

Considering these factors, the patient has a combination of a well-managed breast cancer situation (with no lymph node involvement) and a rectal cancer that, while it has lymphatic invasion, does not show metastasis. The overall prognosis appears favorable given the absence of lymph node metastases and the well-differentiated nature of the breast carcinoma.

Based on this analysis, it is reasonable to conclude that the patient has a good chance of survival after 2.1 years.
