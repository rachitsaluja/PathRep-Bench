(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The patient has a diagnosis of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, with a histologic grade of moderately differentiated. The tumor is staged as pT4a, indicating that it invades the epiglottic cartilage and extends to the hyoid bone. The lymph nodes are positive for metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, with extracapsular extension in some of the nodes.

The patient has a high-risk tumor, with a large primary tumor size (3.9 cm x 3.8 cm x 1.6 cm) and extracapsular extension in multiple lymph nodes. The tumor also invades the epiglottic cartilage and extends to the hyoid bone, which are both considered high-risk features.

Based on the AJCC staging system, the patient's tumor is staged as pT4a pN2c pMx, which corresponds to Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is:

{""stage"" : Stage IV}"
1,"## Model generated chain of thought explanation

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, I will first analyze the pathology report to identify the tumor characteristics and extent of disease.

The report states that the tumor is a poorly differentiated squamous carcinoma that invades bone and has lymphatic and perineural invasion. This suggests that the tumor has a high degree of aggressiveness and has spread to surrounding tissues.

The report also mentions that the tumor is close to the margin of resection, which indicates that the tumor has not been completely removed and may have residual disease.

The report does not provide information on the tumor size, but it does mention that the tumor involves the floor of the mouth and expands into the anterior soft tissue. This suggests that the tumor is likely to be of significant size.

Based on these findings, I would conclude that the patient has Stage IV cancer. The presence of lymphatic and perineural invasion, as well as the close proximity of the tumor to the margin of resection, suggests that the tumor has spread to distant sites and has a high likelihood of recurrence.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IV}"
2,"## Model-generated chain of thought explanation

First, I will identify the key features of the pathology report that are relevant to staging:

* The tumor is a moderately differentiated keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma, 4.0 cm in greatest dimension.
* The tumor extends to within 1 mm of the deep aspect of the medial margin, indicating close proximity to the margin.
* The regional lymph nodes are involved, with metastasis in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes, none more than 6 cm in greatest dimension.
* There is focal extranodal extension of nodal tumor.
* The distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Next, I will apply the AJCC staging criteria for oral cavity cancer:

* The tumor size is 4.0 cm, which falls within the T2 category.
* The tumor has extended to within 1 mm of the deep aspect of the medial margin, which indicates T2a.
* The regional lymph nodes are involved, with metastasis in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes, which indicates N2b.
* There is focal extranodal extension of nodal tumor, which does not affect the staging.

Based on these findings, the patient's stage is determined as follows:

* T: T2a (tumor size 4.0 cm, extending to within 1 mm of the deep aspect of the medial margin)
* N: N2b (metastasis in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes, none more than 6 cm in greatest dimension)
* M: MX (distant metastasis cannot be assessed)

Therefore, the patient's stage is Stage III.

(model generated chain of thought explanation)

First, I will analyze the pathology report to identify the key features of the tumor. The tumor is an invasive keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma, well-differentiated, with a size of 1.9 cm and a focus of carcinoma in situ. The tumor is located on the right tongue, with surgical margins of 1.6 mm to the deep margin and 3 mm to the medial margin, and the remaining margins are greater than 1 cm.

Next, I will examine the lymph node status. The report states that 24 lymph nodes were negative for carcinoma (0/24), and one lymph node was negative for metastatic carcinoma (0/1) in the regional node dissection.

Based on the AJCC Pathologic Stage, the report states that the patient has a pT1 tumor, which means that the tumor is less than 2 cm in greatest dimension, and pNO, which means that there is no evidence of nodal metastasis.

Therefore, the answer is:

{""stage"" : Stage I}"
4,"## Answer

(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The patient has a squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx, specifically in the retromolar trigone region. The tumor is 3.5 cm in greatest dimension, which falls within the pT2 category. The tumor is poorly differentiated, which is a high-grade feature. The lymph nodes examined were 27, and none of them were involved, which is consistent with pNO. There is no evidence of distant metastasis.

Based on the AJCC staging system, the patient's tumor is classified as pT2, pNO, and pM0, which corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is:

{""stage"" : Stage III}"
5,"## Answer

(model generated chain of thought explanation)

First, I will identify the tumor location, which is the glottis region of the larynx. This is a specific location that is considered a high-risk area for cancer.

Next, I will analyze the tumor size, which is 2.6 x 2.6 x 1.0 cm. According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor of this size would be considered T2.

The pathology report also mentions that the tumor has invaded the subglottal and supraglottal regions, which means it has extended beyond the primary tumor site. This is considered a T2 tumor as well.

The report does not mention any evidence of lymph node metastasis (pNO), which is important for determining the stage.

Finally, the report does not mention any distant metastasis or evidence of vascular or nerve invasion, which would indicate a more advanced stage.

Based on this information, I conclude that the patient has Stage II cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage II}"
6,"## Model-generated chain of thought explanation

First, I will identify the tumor location, size, and histopathological features. The tumor is an invasive poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, involving mainly the supraglottis, left piriform sinus, and extending to the epiglottis, involving the false and true vocal cord. The tumor size is approximately 5.0 x 3.0 cm.

Next, I will assess the lymph node involvement. The patient has 5/42 positive lymph nodes (macrometastasis) in the left neck dissection, with extracapsular extension present. The level 2, 3, and 4 lymph nodes are involved, with the largest metastatic focus measuring 2.2 cm.

Considering the tumor size and lymph node involvement, I will evaluate the AJCC staging criteria. According to the 8th edition AJCC staging system, the tumor size is T3 (T3: Tumor >4 cm in greatest dimension). The lymph node involvement is N2c (N2c: Metastasis in 5 or more lymph nodes, with at least one lymph node >6 cm in greatest dimension).

Based on the above evaluation, the patient's stage is Stage IV (Stage IV: Tumor of any size with metastasis to lymph nodes above the supraglottis, mid or low in the neck, or to distant sites).

7,"## Answer

(model generated chain of thought explanation)

First, I will analyze the pathology report to identify the key features that will help me determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

From the report, I can gather the following information:

* The tumor is located in the larynx and measures 4 cm in its greatest dimension, which is greater than 2 cm, indicating that it is a T2 tumor.
* The tumor is moderately differentiated, which is a T2 characteristic.
* The tumor has invaded the deep muscles of the tongue, which is a T2 characteristic.
* There is one lymph node involved with metastasis, which is a N1 characteristic.
* The margins are uninvolved, indicating that the tumor has not invaded the surrounding tissue.

Based on these characteristics, I can determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

The AJCC staging system for laryngeal cancer is as follows:

* T1: Tumor is limited to the mucosa and/or submucosa
* T2: Tumor extends to the deep muscles of the tongue
* N0: No lymph node involvement
* N1: Metastasis in a single lymph node
* M0: No distant metastasis

Given the characteristics of the tumor, I can conclude that the patient has a T2N1M0 tumor, which corresponds to Stage III.

The patient has a squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, with a tumor size of 5.5 cm in greatest dimension and a thickness of 2.5 cm. The tumor is moderately differentiated and has perineural invasion. The lymph nodes in the neck are involved, with 8 out of 59 lymph nodes examined showing metastatic disease. The largest involved lymph node measures 3.1 cm, and extranodal invasion is present.

The patient's pathology report indicates that the tumor is T3 (tumor size > 4 cm in greatest dimension) and N2c (metastasis in bilateral or contralateral lymph nodes, none more than 6 cm in greatest dimension). The patient's tumor is also pMX (distant metastasis cannot be assessed).

Based on the AJCC staging system, the patient's stage is Stage IV.

9,"## Model-generated chain of thought explanation

The patient has a poorly differentiated non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma of the right pyriform sinus, which has invaded the lateral wall of the larynx without bone invasion. The tumor margins are free of tumor.

The pathology report indicates that the patient has metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in multiple lymph nodes, including level II, III, and IV on the left side, and level III on the right side.

The AJCC staging system for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is based on the presence and extent of primary tumor (T), regional lymph nodes (N), and distant metastasis (M). Since the patient has a T3 tumor (invading the lateral wall of the larynx) and N2b disease (metastasis in multiple lymph nodes on both sides of the neck), the stage would be determined by the N category.

According to the AJCC staging system, N2b disease is classified as Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is:

10,"## Model generated chain of thought explanation

The pathology report describes an invasive moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the pharynx, with lymphovascular invasion and metastatic disease in multiple lymph nodes. The tumor is 4.5 cm in maximum dimension, and there are two peritumoral deposits of squamous cell carcinoma, possibly representing two completely replaced lymph nodes.

The report also mentions that the margins are free of tumor, and there is no tumor present in the thyroid gland or vocal cords.

To determine the AJCC stage, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and presence of distant metastasis.

The tumor size is 4.5 cm, which is greater than 2 cm, but less than 4 cm, which falls into the T2 category.

The lymph node involvement is as follows: there is metastatic disease in 1 of 10 right cervical lymph nodes (level I) and 5 of 10 left cervical lymph nodes (levels I, II, and III). This is considered N2b disease.

There is no mention of distant metastasis, so we can assume that the disease has not spread to distant organs.

Based on the above information, the AJCC stage would be Stage III, as the tumor is T2, and there is N2b lymph node involvement.

First, I will analyze the pathology report to identify the key features of the tumor. The report states that the tumor is a squamous cell carcinoma, keratinizing type, with a histologic grade of well-differentiated. This suggests that the tumor is likely to be a low-grade cancer.

Next, I will examine the tumor extent. The report states that the tumor is localized, but does not specify the extent of the tumor. However, the fact that the tumor is ulcerated and involves all parts of the larynx suggests that it may be a larger tumor.

The report also states that there is no evidence of lymph node involvement, which is a good prognostic factor. Additionally, the margins are uninvolved, which suggests that the tumor has not spread to the surrounding tissue.

Based on these findings, I would conclude that the patient has a Stage III cancer. The tumor is localized, but it is a larger tumor that involves all parts of the larynx, and there is no evidence of lymph node involvement. Therefore, the answer is:

The patient has been diagnosed with invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the buccal mucosa, extending to the skin, with a tumor size of 4 cm. The pathology report indicates that the tumor is moderately differentiated and has invaded the skin, but there is no evidence of angiolymphatic invasion or perineural invasion.

The report also states that the margins are free of carcinoma, and the lymph nodes examined (45) are all negative for tumor involvement. This suggests that the tumor has not spread to the regional lymph nodes.

Based on the TNM staging system, the primary tumor (pT) is classified as pT4a, indicating that the tumor has invaded the skin and is greater than 4 cm in size. The regional lymph nodes (pN) are classified as pNO, indicating that there is no evidence of lymph node involvement. The distant metastasis (pM) is classified as pMX, indicating that there is no evidence of distant metastasis.

(model generated chain of thought explanation)

First, I will analyze the pathology report to identify the key information about the tumor. The report states that the patient has invasive squamous cell carcinoma, moderately differentiated, in both the right and left aryepiglottic folds of the larynx. The tumor extends into adjacent cartilage in the left aryepiglottic fold.

Next, I will consider the AJCC staging criteria for squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx. According to the AJCC staging manual, the primary tumor (T) is classified based on the size and extent of the tumor. For T1, the tumor is limited to the glottis or supraglottis and is 2 cm or less in diameter. For T2, the tumor is larger than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in diameter. For T3, the tumor is larger than 4 cm in diameter or extends into the cartilage.

Based on the pathology report, the tumor is described as measuring 2.0 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm in the right aryepiglottic fold and 1.5 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm in aggregate dimension in the left aryepiglottic fold. The tumor extends into adjacent cartilage in the left aryepiglottic fold. Therefore, the tumor is larger than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in diameter, which meets the criteria for T2.

Additionally, the report does not mention any evidence of lymph node metastasis (N) or distant metastasis (M). Therefore, the N and M categories are classified as N0 and M0, respectively.

Finally, I will consider the overall stage (stage grouping) based on the T, N, and M categories. According to the AJCC staging manual, the stage grouping for squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx is as follows: Stage I (T1, N0, M0), Stage II (T2, N0, M0), Stage III (T1-2, N1, M0), and Stage IV (T3-4, N0-1, M0 or T1-4, N2-3, M0).

Based on the above analysis, the patient has Stage II squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx.

* Lymph node involvement: No metastatic squamous cell carcinoma identified in sentinel lymph nodes #1, #2, lymph node #3, and lymph node #4
* Surgical margins: Free of involvement
* Angiolymphatic invasion: Not identified

Based on these findings, the T category is T1, as the tumor is less than 2 cm in size and has not invaded the lymph nodes.

The N category is N0, as no metastatic squamous cell carcinoma was identified in the sentinel lymph nodes or other lymph nodes.

Therefore, the AJCC stage is T1N0.

Next, I will assess the lymph node involvement. The pathology report states that there is metastasis in one lymph node (1/1) with capsular involvement and desmoplasia, indicating N1 disease. Additionally, there are two lymph nodes without capsular involvement among eleven lymph nodes (2/11), indicating N2 disease.

The report does not mention distant metastasis, so I will assume that the disease has not spread to distant organs.

Based on the T3 tumor size and N2 lymph node involvement, the patient's cancer is classified as Stage III.

(model generated chain of thought explanation)

First, I will analyze the pathology report to identify the key features of the tumor and its spread.

The tumor is a squamous cell carcinoma, moderately differentiated, with a maximum tumor dimension of 6.0 cm. It is present at the supero-anterior lip and buccal mucosal margins, and is close (0.2 cm) to the infero-anterior soft tissue margin. The tumor also shows perineural invasion.

The lymph nodes in the right neck, level IA, IB, II-IV, are involved, with six of forty-six lymph nodes (6/46) showing metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. The largest involved lymph node measures 3.5 cm. There is extensive extracapsular extension present.

Based on these findings, I will evaluate the tumor's spread according to the AJCC staging system.

The tumor is T3, as it is more than 4 cm in greatest dimension. The lymph nodes are N2b, as there is metastasis in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes, none more than 6 cm in greatest dimension.

Therefore, the patient has Stage III cancer.

(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The patient has been diagnosed with invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, poorly differentiated, with perineural invasion. The pathology report provides detailed information about the tumor size, location, and margins, as well as the results of immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) tests.

The tumor size is 1.9 cm, and the tumor is located in the left tongue. The margins are free of tumor, and there is no evidence of lymphovascular invasion.

The FISH test results show that the tumor has high polysomy for EGFR, which is a common genetic alteration in squamous cell carcinoma. This suggests that the tumor may be more aggressive and have a poorer prognosis.

Based on the AJCC staging system, the patient's tumor is classified as pT1, which means that the tumor is less than 2 cm in diameter and has not invaded the surrounding tissues. The lymph node status is pN1, which means that there is one positive lymph node.

The patient's overall stage is Stage III, which is based on the combination of the tumor size, location, and lymph node status. The presence of perineural invasion and high polysomy for EGFR also suggest a more aggressive tumor behavior, which is consistent with a Stage III diagnosis.

Therefore, the answer is:

{""stage"" : Stage III}"

(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The patient has a well-differentiated invasive squamous carcinoma of the tongue, with a tumor size of 2.8 cm in the largest dimension, and a depth of invasion of 1.3 cm. The tumor has infiltrative borders with thick cords of more than 4 cells, and there is focal perineural invasion. The lymph nodes in the neck dissection levels I, II, III, and IV are all negative for tumor.

Based on the AJCC staging system, the tumor size and depth of invasion suggest that the patient has a T2 tumor. The presence of perineural invasion suggests that the patient has a high risk of recurrence and distant metastasis.

The patient's lymph nodes are all negative for tumor, which suggests that the patient has a N0 disease. The patient's tumor is also negative for high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV), which suggests that the patient has a low risk of recurrence and distant metastasis.

Therefore, the patient's stage is likely to be Stage III, given the T2 tumor size and depth of invasion, and the N0 disease.

Therefore, the answer is -

33,"## Answer

(model generated chain of thought explanation)

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, I will first analyze the pathology report and identify the relevant information.

The patient has a non-keratinizing poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the right tonsil, with a tumor size of 2.7 x 2.6 x 0.7 cm. The tumor is positive at the deep and superior margins, but negative at the lateral and medial margins.

The lymph nodes examined were 49, with 2 positive for metastasis. The largest positive lymph node was 4 mm in greatest dimension.

Based on the AJCC staging manual, 7th edition, the patient's tumor is classified as pT2, as it measures more than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension.

The patient has regional lymph node metastasis, with 2 positive lymph nodes in Level II, which is classified as pN2b.

Therefore, the patient's stage is Stage III, as the tumor is larger than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension, and there is regional lymph node metastasis.

Therefore, the answer is:

{""stage"" : Stage III}"
34,"## Answer

(model generated chain of thought explanation)

First, I will identify the key information from the pathology report:

* The tumor is a moderately differentiated squamous carcinoma with perineural involvement and infiltration of skeletal muscle.
* The tumor size is 2.6 x 2.2 x 2.1 cm.
* The tumor extends to the right lingual surgical resection margin.
* The resection margins are free of tumor, except for the right lingual margin, which is involved by the tumor.

Next, I will consider the AJCC staging criteria for oral cavity cancer:

* T stage: The tumor size is 2.6 x 2.2 x 2.1 cm, which corresponds to T3 (tumor > 4 cm in greatest dimension).
* N stage: The tumor extends to the right lingual surgical resection margin, which indicates N1 (tumor present at the resection margin).
* M stage: The report does not mention any distant metastasis, so M0 (no distant metastasis).

Based on the T and N stages, the patient has Stage III cancer.

Therefore, the answer is -

(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The patient has a total laryngectomy and bilateral neck dissection for a supraglottic squamous cell carcinoma. The pathology report indicates that the tumor is 4.5 cm in maximum dimension, moderately differentiated, and has perineural and angiolymphatic invasion. The surgical margins are free of tumor.

The report also states that one of 56 lymph nodes examined is positive for metastatic moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, and the lymph node is located at level 3. This suggests that the tumor has spread to the lymph nodes.

Based on the TNM staging system, the T stage is pT4a, indicating that the tumor is greater than 4 cm in maximum dimension and invades the thyroid cartilage. The N stage is pN2a, indicating that there is metastasis to a single lymph node. The M stage is pMX, indicating that there is no distant metastasis.

Therefore, the patient has Stage IV cancer, as the tumor has spread to the lymph nodes and has invaded the thyroid cartilage.

Therefore, the answer is:

The patient has a diagnosis of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the tonsillar bed, portion of mandible, and salivary gland, with a tumor size of 3.5 cm in greatest dimension. The tumor is moderately differentiated, invades the underlying skeletal muscle, and has focal invasion of minor salivary gland tissue. The tumor also has foci of angiolymphatic and perineural space invasion.

The patient has a pT2 tumor, which is defined as a tumor that is greater than 2 cm but not greater than 4 cm in greatest dimension. The patient also has a pN1 tumor, which is defined as the presence of metastatic carcinoma in one to three lymph nodes.

The patient's AJCC stage is determined by the combination of the pT and pN categories. According to the AJCC staging manual, 6th edition, a patient with a pT2 tumor and a pN1 tumor would be classified as Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is:

The pathology report describes a patient with a squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue and pharynx, with metastatic disease in one of the two lymph nodes. The tumor is moderately differentiated and has focal perineural invasion. The margins are free of tumor.

The report also mentions that the tumor has infiltrated through soft tissue and is located 4 and 7 cm from the superior soft tissue resection margin. The tumor extends to the sternal bone but does not infiltrate it. The patient has a total thyroidectomy, and the thyroid gland is free of tumor.

Based on the AJCC staging system, the patient's tumor is considered T4, as it has infiltrated through soft tissue and is located 4 and 7 cm from the superior soft tissue resection margin.

The patient has metastatic disease in one of the two lymph nodes, which is considered N1. The patient has no evidence of distant metastasis, so the M stage is M0.

Therefore, the patient's stage is Stage IV, as it meets the criteria for T4N1M0.

The patient has been diagnosed with oral carcinoma, and the pathology report provides detailed information about the tumor and its characteristics. The tumor is an invasive squamous cell carcinoma, keratinizing, poorly differentiated, exophytic pattern, with a greatest dimension of 3.0 cm. The tumor has invaded the bone, but there is no angiolymphatic or perineural invasion.

The report also mentions that the tumor is staged as pT4a, indicating that it has invaded the mandible, but the margins are free of tumor. Additionally, the report states that there is no distant metastasis (pMX) and no regional lymph node involvement (pNO).

Based on the information provided, I conclude that the patient has Stage IV cancer, as the tumor has invaded the mandible and there is no evidence of distant metastasis or regional lymph node involvement.

40,"## Model Generated Chain of Thought Explanation

To identify the AJCC Stage of the Cancer, I will follow the guidelines provided by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC). The AJCC staging system for squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity is based on the tumor size (T), lymph node involvement (N), and presence of distant metastasis (M).

First, I will evaluate the tumor size (T). According to the pathology report, the tumor size is 5 cm, which falls into the T2 category.

Next, I will evaluate the lymph node involvement (N). The pathology report states that there are six lymph nodes with normal morphological structure, which indicates that there is no lymph node involvement (N0).

Finally, I will evaluate the presence of distant metastasis (M). The pathology report does not mention any distant metastasis, so I will assume that there is no distant metastasis (M0).

Based on the T2N0M0 classification, the patient has Stage II cancer.

## Model Generated Chain of Thought Explanation:

The pathology report describes a patient with squamous cell carcinoma of the mandible, buccal mucosa, and floor of the mouth. The report highlights the presence of multiple positive margins, including the 12 o'clock margin, 5-10 o'clock position, and 6 o'clock position. Additionally, there is evidence of perineural invasion and questionable lymphatic invasion.

Based on the report, the tumor is considered invasive, with poorly differentiated and moderately differentiated components. The margins of resection are free of tumor, but there is focal moderate dysplasia at the margin. The presence of perineural invasion and questionable lymphatic invasion suggests that the tumor has spread beyond the primary site.

Given the extent of the disease, I would conclude that the patient has Stage III cancer. The AJCC staging system for oral cavity cancer considers the presence of positive margins, perineural invasion, and lymph node involvement as indicators of advanced disease. In this case, the presence of multiple positive margins and perineural invasion suggests that the tumor has spread beyond the primary site, making Stage III the most likely diagnosis.

## Answer:

42,"## Answer

(model generated chain of thought explanation)

The patient has a moderately differentiated invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the right tongue, with invasion into the deep tongue muscles and no invasion into the mandible. The tumor measures 5.0 cm in greatest dimension, with all margins negative. The patient has no lymph node metastasis, as all lymph nodes examined were negative for malignancy.

The AJCC staging system for oral cavity cancer is based on the tumor size, lymph node status, and presence of distant metastasis. Since the tumor size is greater than 4 cm, it falls into the T4a category. Since there is no lymph node metastasis, the N category is pN0. The presence of distant metastasis is not mentioned in the report, so the M category is pM0.

According to the AJCC staging system, the patient's tumor stage is T4a, N0, M0, which corresponds to Stage IVA.

Therefore, the answer is:

43,"## Model-generated chain of thought explanation

First, I will analyze the pathology report to identify the key features of the tumor. The tumor is an invasive squamous cell carcinoma, moderately differentiated, with a size of 3.4 cm in the largest dimension. The tumor invades 1.4 cm deep and has a infiltrative border with thick cords of more than 4 cells. Perineural invasion is present, but moderate, and vascular invasion is absent. Lymphocyte infiltration is moderate.

Next, I will examine the lymph node status. The pathology report states that there are no tumor cells present in the lymph nodes from levels I, II, III, and IV. This indicates that the tumor has not metastasized to the lymph nodes.

The report also mentions that the tumor approaches the nearest lateral gingival margin to 0.7 cm, the nearest medial margin to 1.0 cm, and the nearest deep margin to 2.2 cm. This suggests that the tumor is locally advanced, but has not invaded beyond the tongue.

Based on the above findings, I will determine the AJCC stage of the cancer. According to the AJCC staging system, the T stage is T2 (tumor size > 2 cm but ≤ 4 cm, and/or invasion of the tongue). The N stage is N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis). The M stage is M0 (no distant metastasis).

Therefore, the AJCC stage of the cancer is Stage II.

The pathology report describes an invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, with a tumor size of 3.0 cm in greatest dimension. The report also mentions that the tumor involves the bilateral inferior epiglottis and extends through the epiglottis into the pre-epiglottic space.

The report states that the lymph nodes are negative for malignancy, with 19 lymph nodes examined from the left level 2, 3, and 4, 5 lymph nodes from the right level 2, 1 lymph node from the left level 1, and 11 lymph nodes from the supraglottic larynx. This suggests that the tumor has not metastasized to the lymph nodes.

The report also mentions that the thyroid cartilage is not present, which is an important factor in determining the stage of the cancer.

Based on the information provided, the AJCC stage of the cancer is likely Stage III (pT3, N0, MX). The ""pT3"" indicates that the tumor is 3 cm or larger in greatest dimension, and the ""N0"" indicates that the lymph nodes are negative for malignancy. The ""MX"" indicates that the distant metastasis is unknown.
