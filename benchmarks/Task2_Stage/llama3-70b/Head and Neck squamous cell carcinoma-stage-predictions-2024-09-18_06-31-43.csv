To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the primary tumor (T), lymph node involvement (N), and distant metastasis (M).

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The primary tumor (T) is classified as pT4a, which means the tumor has invaded the hyoid bone and/or thyroid cartilage, and/or has invaded the laryngeal cartilage and/or has extrinsic muscle invasion.
* Lymph node involvement (N) is classified as pN2c, which means there are multiple lymph nodes involved on both sides of the neck, with at least one node larger than 3 cm in greatest dimension.
* There is no evidence of distant metastasis (M), so M is classified as pMx (unknown).

Based on the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a pT4a primary tumor, pN2c lymph node involvement, and pMx distant metastasis would correspond to Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is:

{""stage"" : Stage IV}"
1,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions ""POORLY DIFFERENTIATED SQUAMOUS CARCINOMA INVADING BONE"" in the anterior mandible, which indicates that the tumor has invaded the bone (T4).
2. The report also mentions ""LYMPHATIC AND PERINEURAL INVASION"" in the floor of mouth, which suggests that the tumor has invaded lymphatic vessels and nerves.
3. However, the report states that the bone margins of resection are free of tumor, and the soft tissue margins are also free of tumor, except for the anterior mucosal margin, which has been disrupted but is free of tumor.
4. The report mentions that five lymph nodes were examined, and none of them showed tumor involvement (N0).
5. There is no mention of distant metastases in the report.

Based on the above information, we can determine the T, N, and M stages as follows:

* T stage: T4 (tumor invades bone)
* N stage: N0 (no lymph node involvement)
* M stage: M0 (no distant metastases)

According to the AJCC staging system, a T4N0M0 stage corresponds to Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IV}"
2,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size (T), regional lymph nodes (N), and distant metastasis (M).

From the pathology report, we can extract the following information:

* Tumor size (T): The tumor is 4 cm in greatest dimension, which corresponds to T2 (tumor more than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension).
* Regional lymph nodes (N): There are metastases in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes (pN2b), with focal extranodal extension.
* Distant metastasis (M): There is no evidence of distant metastasis (pMX: cannot be assessed).

Based on the AJCC staging system, the T2 tumor and pN2b lymph nodes correspond to Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IV}"
3,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC Stage of the cancer.

First, we need to identify the primary tumor (T) stage. The report states that the tumor is 1.9 cm in size, and there is no angiolymphatic invasion or perineural invasion. The surgical margins are 1.6 mm to the deep margin and 3 mm to the medial margin, with the remaining margins >1 cm. Based on this information, the primary tumor stage is T1.

Next, we need to determine the nodal (N) stage. The report states that 24 lymph nodes were examined, and none of them showed evidence of carcinoma. Therefore, the nodal stage is N0.

Since the primary tumor stage is T1 and the nodal stage is N0, the overall AJCC Stage is Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
4,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (pT)**: The report states that the tumor is 3.5 cm in greatest dimension, which corresponds to pT2 (Tumor more than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension).
2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN)**: The report indicates that there is no regional lymph node metastasis (pN0), as 27 lymph nodes were examined and none were involved.
3. **Distant Metastasis (pM)**: There is no mention of distant metastasis, so pM0.

Based on the AJCC staging system, the stage is determined by the combination of pT, pN, and pM. In this case, we have:

* pT2 (tumor size 3.5 cm)
* pN0 (no lymph node metastasis)
* pM0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC staging system, this corresponds to **Stage II**.

Therefore, the answer is:
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
5,"## Answer

1. The report mentions ""pT2"", which indicates the primary tumor is of size 2.6 x 2.6 x 1.0 cm, invading the subglottal and supraglottal regions. According to the AJCC staging system, a T2 tumor is larger than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension, and may involve the supraglottis and/or glottis and/or subglottis.

2. The report also mentions ""pNO"", which indicates there is no evidence of regional lymph node metastasis.

3. There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report.

Based on the above information, the tumor is classified as T2N0M0, which corresponds to Stage II according to the AJCC staging system.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
6,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary tumor (T)**: The tumor size is 5.0 x 3.0 cm, and it invades the anterior space, thyroid cartilage, and epiglottic cartilage with extensive perineural invasion. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual, this corresponds to T4a (tumor invades thyroid cartilage, trachea, cricoid cartilage, or cervical esophagus).

2. **Lymph nodes (N)**: There are 5/42 positive lymph nodes (macrometastasis) with extracapsular extension present. The largest metastatic focus measures 2.2 cm. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual, this corresponds to N3b (metastasis in a lymph node > 3 cm in greatest dimension).

3. **Distant metastasis (M)**: There is no evidence of distant metastasis in the report.

Based on the above, the AJCC stage of the cancer is Stage IV (T4a, N3b, M0).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IV}"
7,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Tumor size and extent**: The tumor size is 4 x 2 cm, which is a significant size, but not explicitly stated as T1, T2, T3, or T4. However, the tumor extent is mentioned as ""Deep muscles of the tongue"", which suggests a T3 tumor (T3: Tumor invades postcricoid area, pre-epiglottic space, paraglottic space, and/or minor thyroid cartilage, thyroid gland, or cervical esophagus).

2. **Lymph node involvement**: The report states that 1/4 lymph nodes are positive for metastasis (Cervical 1/4), which indicates N1 disease (N1: Metastasis in a single ipsilateral lymph node, ≤3 cm in greatest dimension).

3. **Margins and distant metastasis**: The margins are uninvolved, and there is no mention of distant metastasis.

Considering the above factors, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* Tumor size and extent: T3
* Lymph node involvement: N1
* Distant metastasis: M0 (not mentioned)

According to the AJCC staging system, a T3N1M0 corresponds to **Stage III**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
8,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The tumor size is 5.5 cm, which corresponds to T3 (tumor more than 4 cm in greatest dimension).
* There is metastasis in bilateral lymph nodes (levels I, II, and III on the left side and levels II and III on the right side), with extranodal invasion present. This corresponds to N2c (metastasis in bilateral or contralateral lymph nodes, none more than 6 cm in greatest dimension).
* There is no distant metastasis (pMX: Distant metastasis cannot be assessed).

Based on the TNM classification, the AJCC stage is determined by combining the T, N, and M categories. In this case, the stage is:

T3 (tumor more than 4 cm in greatest dimension)
N2c (metastasis in bilateral or contralateral lymph nodes, none more than 6 cm in greatest dimension)
M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC staging system, the corresponding stage is Stage III.

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the right pyriform sinus, measuring 3.5 x 1.5 x 1.1 cm, and has not invaded the bone. This corresponds to a T2 tumor (tumor > 2 cm but ≤ 4 cm in greatest dimension).
2. The report mentions metastatic squamous carcinoma in multiple lymph nodes on both sides of the neck, including levels II, III, and IV. This indicates the presence of nodal metastases (N3).
3. There is no evidence of distant metastases (M0) mentioned in the report.

According to the AJCC staging system, a T2 tumor with N3 nodal metastases and no distant metastases corresponds to Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is -

10,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the pharynx, left posterior wall, with a maximum dimension of 4.5 cm. This corresponds to a T2 tumor (T2: Tumor > 2 cm but ≤ 4 cm in greatest dimension).
2. The report mentions lymphovascular invasion, which does not affect the T stage.
3. There are two peritumoral deposits of squamous cell carcinoma, possibly representing two completely replaced lymph nodes. This is considered N3b disease (N3b: Metastasis in a lymph node > 6 cm in greatest dimension).
4. Additionally, there are metastases in 1 of 10 right cervical lymph nodes and 5 of 10 left cervical lymph nodes. This further supports the N3b classification.
5. The margins are free of tumor, and there is no evidence of distant metastases (M0).

Based on the AJCC staging system, a T2 primary tumor with N3b lymph node metastases corresponds to Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IV}"
11,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and metastasis.

From the pathology report, we know that the tumor size is 5.0 cm (greatest dimension), and it is moderately to poorly differentiated. The tumor has infiltrated salivary glands and skeletal muscle, including the tongue.

The lymph node involvement is significant, with metastatic carcinoma present in four of 35 lymph nodes. The largest positive node is 2.5 cm (level III), and three other positive nodes (level IIA, III, and IV) are approximately 1.5 cm, 1.2 cm, and 1.1 cm, respectively. Both level III nodes and the level IIA node have extracapsular extension.

There is no evidence of distant metastasis (MX).

Based on the AJCC staging system, the primary tumor is classified as T4a (tumor invades adjacent structures, such as the skeletal muscle of the tongue), and the lymph node involvement is classified as N2b (metastasis in multiple lymph nodes, with at least one node larger than 3 cm and extracapsular extension).

Therefore, the overall stage is Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IV}"
12,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (T)**: The tumor size is 1 x 0 x 1.5 cm, which is relatively small. The tumor extent is described as ""Localized, NOS"" (not otherwise specified), indicating that the tumor is confined to the larynx. There is no evidence of invasion into surrounding structures.

2. **Lymph Nodes (N)**: The report does not specify the involvement of lymph nodes, which suggests that there is no evidence of lymph node metastasis.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report.

Based on the above analysis, the TNM classification would be T1N0M0.

According to the AJCC staging system for laryngeal cancer, a T1N0M0 classification corresponds to **Stage I**.

Therefore, the answer is -

13,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the primary tumor (T), regional lymph nodes (N), and distant metastasis (M).

**Primary Tumor (T):**
The tumor is located in the supraglottis with extension into the glottis, and its greatest dimension is 3.6 cm. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual, a tumor of this size is classified as T2.

**Regional Lymph Nodes (N):**
The pathology report shows metastasis in bilateral lymph nodes, with none larger than 6 cm in greatest dimension. This is classified as N2c.

**Distant Metastasis (M):**
There is no evidence of distant metastasis in the pathology report, so M0.

**AJCC Stage:**
Based on the T, N, and M classifications, the AJCC stage is Stage III (T2N2cM0).

14,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (pT)**: The report states that the primary tumor is pT4a, which means the tumor has invaded the skin of the cheek (buccal mucosa) and is larger than 4 cm in greatest dimension.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN)**: The report states that 45 regional lymph nodes were examined, and none of them were involved with tumor (pNO).

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM)**: The report states that there is no distant metastasis (pMX).

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system for oral cavity cancer, a tumor with a pT4a primary tumor and pNO regional lymph nodes is classified as **Stage IVA**.

However, since the options provided do not include Stage IVA, we need to consider the closest match. Between the options, Stage III and Stage IV are the most relevant. Since the tumor has not metastasized to distant sites (pMX), it is not Stage IV. Therefore, the closest match is **Stage III**, which corresponds to a tumor with a pT4 primary tumor and pNO regional lymph nodes.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
15,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the primary tumor (T), regional lymph nodes (N), and distant metastasis (M).

17,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, I will carefully review the pathology report and extract the relevant information.

First, I note that the patient has invasive squamous cell carcinoma in both the right and left aryepiglottic folds, which suggests that the tumor is bilateral.

The report also mentions that the tumor is extending into adjacent cartilage in the left aryepiglottic fold, which indicates that the tumor has invaded the cartilage.

According to the AJCC staging system, the primary tumor (T) is classified as T3 if the tumor invades the cartilage or bone. Since the tumor has invaded the cartilage, I would classify the primary tumor as T3.

There is no mention of lymph node involvement or distant metastases in the report, so I would assume that the lymph node status (N) is N0 and the metastasis status (M) is M0.

Based on the T3N0M0 classification, I would determine the AJCC stage of the cancer as Stage III.

34,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can gather the following information:

* Tumor size: 2.6 x 2.2 x 2.1 cm, which is larger than 2 cm but not larger than 4 cm (T2).
* The tumor invades the mandible (bone invasion) and infiltrates skeletal muscle.
* The tumor extends to the right lingual surgical resection margin, but the new right lingual margin is free of tumor.
* There is no mention of lymph node involvement or metastasis.

Based on the AJCC staging system, a T2 tumor with bone invasion and no lymph node involvement or metastasis corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
35,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The tumor size is 4.5 cm, which corresponds to T4a (tumor invades the thyroid cartilage).
* There is lymph node involvement, with one positive lymph node out of 56 examined (N2a).
* There is no distant metastasis (MX).

According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a T4a primary tumor, N2a lymph node involvement, and no distant metastasis corresponds to Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is:

{""stage"" : Stage IV}"
36,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The tumor size is 3.5 cm in greatest dimension, which corresponds to T2 (tumor > 2 cm but ≤ 4 cm).
* There is metastasis to one of 26 lymph nodes (1/11 level II lymph nodes and 0/15 level III lymph nodes), which corresponds to N1 (metastasis to a single ipsilateral lymph node, ≤ 3 cm in greatest dimension).
* There is no evidence of distant metastasis (M0).

According to the AJCC staging manual (6th edition, 2002), the minimal pTNM classification is pT2, pN1, pM0, which corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
37,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor's primary site, size, and extent, as well as the presence of lymph node metastases and distant metastases.

From the pathology report, we can gather the following information:

* The primary tumor is an invasive, moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma located in the tongue, with a size of 2.0 x 1.5 cm on the surface and 1.2 cm in depth.
* The tumor has focal perineural invasion, but all margins are free of tumor.
* There is metastatic squamous cell carcinoma present in 1 of 2 lymph nodes in the left modified neck dissection.
* There is no evidence of distant metastases in the thyroid, skin, or other tissues.

Based on the AJCC staging system, the primary tumor (T) is classified as T2, as it is larger than 2 cm but not larger than 4 cm. The presence of lymph node metastases (N) is classified as N1, as there is metastasis in a single ipsilateral lymph node. There is no evidence of distant metastases (M), so M0.

Therefore, the overall stage is Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
38,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the primary tumor (pT), regional lymph nodes (pN), and distant metastasis (pM).

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The primary tumor (pT) is classified as pT3, as it measures more than 4 cm in greatest dimension.
* The regional lymph nodes (pN) are classified as pN2b, as there are metastases in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes, none more than 6 cm in greatest dimension.
* There is no distant metastasis (pM).

According to the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 7th edition, 2010, the stage is determined by the combination of pT, pN, and pM. In this case, the stage is:

* pT3 (primary tumor)
* pN2b (regional lymph nodes)
* pM0 (no distant metastasis)

Therefore, the AJCC stage of the cancer is Stage III.

39,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the primary tumor (pT), regional lymph nodes (pN), and distant metastasis (pM).

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The primary tumor (pT) is classified as pT4a, which indicates that the tumor has invaded the bone (mandible).
* The regional lymph nodes (pN) are classified as pNO, which means that none of the 44 regional lymph nodes examined were involved by tumor.
* The distant metastasis (pM) is classified as pMX, which means that the presence or absence of distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Based on the AJCC staging system, a pT4a primary tumor with no regional lymph node involvement (pNO) and unknown distant metastasis (pMX) corresponds to Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IV}"
40,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (T)**: The tumor size is 5 cm, which corresponds to T3 according to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual for oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N)**: Six lymph nodes were examined, and all had normal morphological structure, indicating no lymph node metastasis (N0).

3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the pathology report, so M0.

4. Now, let's determine the stage based on the TNM classification: T3N0M0.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual, a T3N0M0 corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
41,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions ""INVASIVE POORLY DIFFERENTIATED SQUAMOUS CARCINOMA"" in the mandible, which indicates a primary tumor (T) with a high degree of malignancy.
2. The tumor size is not explicitly stated, but we can infer that it is larger than 4 cm based on the description of the lesion in the mandible (8.0 cm X 2.0 cm).
3. The report mentions ""PERINEURAL INVASION"" and ""QUESTIONABLE LYMPHATICS,"" which suggests that the tumor may have invaded nearby nerves and possibly lymphatic vessels.
4. There is no evidence of distant metastases (M0) in the report.
5. The report mentions multiple re-excision biopsies with varying degrees of dysplasia and carcinoma in situ, indicating that the tumor has invaded the surrounding tissues.

Based on these findings, we can assign the following TNM classifications:

* T: T4 (invasive tumor with perineural invasion and possible lymphatic invasion)
* N: N0 (no evidence of lymph node involvement)
* M: M0 (no evidence of distant metastases)

According to the AJCC staging system, a T4N0M0 classification corresponds to Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IV}"
42,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the right tongue, and it measures 5.0 cm in greatest dimension (pT4a).
2. The tumor has invaded the deep tongue muscles but not the mandible.
3. All margins are negative, with the closest margin (posterior) being 0.6 cm.
4. There is no lymph node involvement (pNo).

According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a size greater than 4 cm (pT4a) and no lymph node involvement (pNo) corresponds to Stage IVA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IVA}"
43,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is an invasive squamous cell carcinoma located in the left partial glossectomy specimen, with a size of 3.4 cm in largest dimension and a depth of invasion of 1.4 cm.
2. The tumor has an infiltrative border with thick cords > 4 cells, and perineural invasion is present, but vascular invasion is absent.
3. The mucosal margin is negative for invasive carcinoma, and the deep margin is also negative for invasive carcinoma. However, there is severe dysplasia present at the posterolateral margin.
4. The lymph nodes from levels I, II, III, and IV are all negative for tumor presence, with a total of 0/33 lymph nodes involved.

Based on the TNM staging system, the primary tumor (T) is classified as T2, as it is larger than 2 cm but not larger than 4 cm. The absence of lymph node involvement (N) means that N is classified as N0. Since there is no evidence of distant metastasis (M), M is classified as M0.

According to the AJCC staging system, a T2N0M0 classification corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
44,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The diagnosis is invasive squamous cell carcinoma, moderately differentiated, measuring 3.0 cm in greatest dimension, involving the bilateral inferior epiglottis and extending through the epiglottis into the pre-epiglottic space.

2. The tumor is located in the supraglottic larynx, and the thyroid cartilage is not present.

3. The lymph nodes are negative for malignancy, with 0/19 lymph nodes positive on the left side, 0/5 lymph nodes positive on the right side, and 0/11 lymph nodes positive in the supraglottic larynx.

4. The comment section mentions that this corresponds to AJCC stage III (pT3, NO, MX).

Based on the above information, we can conclude that the tumor is a primary laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, with a size of 3.0 cm (T3), no lymph node involvement (N0), and no distant metastasis (MX). This corresponds to AJCC stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
