To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor (T), node (N), and metastasis (M) components.

The tumor (T) component is classified as pT4a, which indicates that the tumor has invaded the epiglottic cartilage and the hyoid bone.

The node (N) component is classified as pN2c, which indicates that there are multiple lymph nodes involved on both sides of the neck, with the largest node measuring 3.2 cm in greatest dimension.

The metastasis (M) component is classified as pMx, which indicates that there is no distant metastasis.

Based on the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a pT4a classification and a pN2c classification would correspond to Stage IV. However, since there is no distant metastasis (pMx), the final stage would be Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
1,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions ""POORLY DIFFERENTIATED SQUAMOUS CARCINOMA INVADING BONE"" in the anterior mandible, indicating that the tumor has invaded the bone.

2. The report also mentions ""LYMPHATIC AND PERINEURAL INVASION FLOOR OF MOUTH"", which suggests that the tumor has invaded the lymphatic vessels and perineural spaces in the floor of the mouth.

3. However, the report states that ""Five lymph nodes, no tumor"" were found in the submandibular gland, indicating that there is no lymph node involvement.

4. The tumor is described as ""CLOSE TO MARGIN OF RESECTION"" in the floor of the mouth, but the bone margins of resection are free of tumor.

5. Based on the AJCC staging system, the primary tumor (T) is classified as T4 due to the invasion of the bone.

6. Since there is no lymph node involvement (N0), the nodal status does not affect the overall stage.

7. There is no mention of distant metastases (M0), so the metastatic status does not affect the overall stage.

8. Therefore, the overall stage is determined by the primary tumor (T4) and the absence of lymph node involvement (N0) and distant metastases (M0).

According to the AJCC staging system, a T4N0M0 tumor corresponds to Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IV}"
2,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size (T), regional lymph nodes (N), and distant metastasis (M).

From the pathology report, we can extract the following information:

* Tumor size (T): The tumor is 4 cm in greatest dimension, which corresponds to T2 (Tumor more than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension).
* Regional lymph nodes (N): There are metastases in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes (pN2b), with 3 out of 51 nodes involved, and focal extranodal extension is present.
* Distant metastasis (M): The report states pMX, which means distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Based on the TNM classification, the patient has a T2 tumor, N2b regional lymph nodes, and MX distant metastasis.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual, a T2N2bMX corresponds to Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IV}"
3,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor (T) is described as a 1.9 cm invasive keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma with a well-differentiated histologic grade. The extent of invasion is not specified, but angiolymphatic invasion and perineural invasion are not identified. This corresponds to a T1 tumor, which is defined as a tumor ≤ 2 cm in greatest dimension.

2. The surgical margins are reported as 1.6 mm to the deep margin, 3 mm to the medial margin, and >1 cm to the remaining margins. This indicates that the tumor is completely excised with negative margins.

3. The lymph nodes (N) are reported as 24 lymph nodes negative for carcinoma (0/24). This corresponds to an N0 lymph node status, indicating no regional lymph node metastases.

4. There is no mention of distant metastases (M) in the report.

Based on the above information, the AJCC pathologic stage is pT1 pNO, which corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
4,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the primary tumor (pT), regional lymph nodes (pN), and distant metastasis (pM).

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The primary tumor (pT) is classified as pT2, which means the tumor is more than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension.
* The regional lymph nodes (pN) are classified as pN0, which means there is no regional lymph node metastasis.
* There is no mention of distant metastasis (pM), so we can assume it is not applicable.

According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a pT2 classification and pN0 classification would correspond to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
5,"## Answer

1. The report mentions ""pT2"", which indicates the primary tumor (T) is of size 2.6 x 2.6 x 1.0 cm, invading the subglottal and supraglottal regions. According to the AJCC staging system, a T2 tumor is larger than 1 cm but not more than 2 cm in greatest dimension, and may involve the supraglottis and/or glottis and/or subglottis.

2. The report also mentions ""pNO (Delphian)"", which indicates there is no regional lymph node metastasis (N0).

3. There is no mention of distant metastasis (M) in the report.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* T2 (primary tumor size and invasion)
* N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis)
* M0 (no distant metastasis, assumed since not mentioned)

According to the AJCC staging system, a T2N0M0 corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"

10,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the pharynx, left posterior wall, with a maximum dimension of 4.5 cm. This corresponds to a T2 tumor, as it is larger than 2 cm but not larger than 4 cm (T1: ≤2 cm, T2: >2 cm but ≤4 cm, T3: >4 cm, T4: invades adjacent structures).

2. The report mentions lymphovascular invasion, which does not affect the T stage.

3. There are two peritumoral deposits of squamous cell carcinoma, possibly representing two completely replaced lymph nodes. This is considered N3 disease, as there are multiple lymph nodes involved (N1: 1-2 lymph nodes, N2: 3-6 lymph nodes, N3: ≥7 lymph nodes).

4. The report also mentions metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in 1 of 10 right cervical lymph nodes and 5 of 10 left cervical lymph nodes. This further supports the N3 classification.

5. There is no mention of distant metastases, so the M stage is M0.

Based on the above information, the AJCC stage can be determined as follows:

T stage: T2 (primary tumor size)
N stage: N3 (multiple lymph nodes involved)
M stage: M0 (no distant metastases)

According to the AJCC staging system, a T2N3M0 classification corresponds to Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IV}"
11,"## Answer

The patient's pathology report indicates that the tumor has invaded the salivary glands and skeletal muscle, and has also metastasized to four lymph nodes (level IIA, III, and IV). The largest positive node is 2.5 cm in size, and three other positive nodes are approximately 1.5 cm, 1.2 cm, and 1.1 cm in size. Additionally, the report mentions that the carcinoma is extensively present at the cauterized superior aspect of the lateral surgical margin, focally at the cauterized posterior margin, closely approaching the inferolateral margin, and less than 0.1 cm to the medial uvula margin.

Based on the AJCC 2002 staging system, the minimum pathologic stage is pT4aN2bMX. The ""pT4a"" indicates that the tumor has invaded the adjacent structures (salivary glands and skeletal muscle), and the ""N2b"" indicates that there are multiple lymph nodes involved (four in this case), with at least one node larger than 3 cm in size. The ""MX"" indicates that the presence of distant metastases cannot be assessed.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IV}"
12,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor's characteristics, lymph node involvement, and metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can gather the following information:

* The tumor is an invasive squamous cell carcinoma, keratinizing type, moderately differentiated, with a maximum dimension of 2.1 cm.
* The tumor involves the left and right supraglottis, with transglottic extension to the left and right true vocal cords.
* The tumor also involves the pre-epiglottic and paraglottic spaces, with thyroid cartilage invasion.
* Angiolymphatic invasion is present, but perineural invasion is not present.
* The surgical margins are free of tumor.

Regarding lymph node involvement:

* Micrometastatic squamous cell carcinoma is present in one of 25 lymph nodes on the left side (<0.1 cm).
* Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma is present in two of 14 lymph nodes on the right side (0.5 cm).
* There is no extracapsular spread.

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the cancer:

1. Primary site: Larynx - This indicates the primary tumor is located in the larynx.
2. Tumor size: 5.5 cm - This is a significant size, but we need to consider other factors to determine the T stage.
3. Ulceration: present - This is a negative prognostic factor.
4. Mucosa, cartilage plan, and skeletal muscle invasion - This indicates the tumor has invaded local structures, which is a T4a factor.
5. Lymphatic invasion: present - This is a negative prognostic factor.
6. Metastasis in two lymph nodes without capsular involvement among eleven lymph nodes (2/11) - This indicates N2b disease, as there are multiple lymph nodes involved on the same side of the neck as the primary tumor.
7. No distant metastases are mentioned in the report.

Based on the above factors, we can determine the TNM stages as follows:

* T stage: T4a (due to invasion of local structures)
* N stage: N2b (due to multiple lymph nodes involved on the same side of the neck as the primary tumor)
* M stage: M0 (no distant metastases)

34,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC Stage of the Cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can gather the following information:

* Tumor size: 2.6 x 2.2 x 2.1 cm (T2)
* Tumor extension: Invades mandible and infiltrates skeletal muscle
* Perineural involvement: Present
* Resection margins: Initially, the tumor extends to the right lingual surgical resection margin, but a supplemental report shows that the resection margins are free of tumor.
* Lymph node involvement: Not mentioned in the report
* Metastasis: Not mentioned in the report

Based on the tumor size (T2) and the fact that it invades the mandible, we can classify the tumor as T4a. The absence of lymph node involvement and metastasis suggests N0 and M0, respectively.

Therefore, the AJCC Stage of the Cancer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IVA}"
35,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to analyze the pathology report and identify the key features that affect staging.

From the report, we can see that the patient has a laryngeal carcinoma, specifically a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, located in the right supraglottis and pyriform sinus, extending into the thyroid cartilage. The tumor measures 4.5 cm in maximum dimension.

The report also indicates that there is perineural invasion and angiolymphatic invasion present. Additionally, one of the 56 lymph nodes examined is positive for metastatic disease, specifically in the right level 3 lymph node, which measures 3.1 cm.

The surgical margins of resection are free of tumor, and there is no extracapsular spread present.

Using the AJCC staging system, we can determine the T stage, N stage, and M stage as follows:

* T stage: The tumor is classified as T4a, as it extends into the thyroid cartilage.
* N stage: The presence of a single positive lymph node in the right level 3 lymph node, which measures 3.1 cm, corresponds to an N2a stage.
* M stage: There is no evidence of distant metastases, so the M stage is MX.

Based on these stages, we can determine the overall AJCC stage of the cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IV}"
36,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The tumor size is 3.5 cm in greatest dimension, which corresponds to T2 (pT2).
* There is lymph node involvement, with metastatic carcinoma found in one of 26 lymph nodes (1/11 level II lymph nodes and 0/15 level III lymph nodes). This corresponds to N1 (pN1).
* There is no evidence of distant metastasis (pMx).

According to the AJCC staging manual, 6th edition, 2002, the minimal pTNM classification is pT2, pN1, pMx, which corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
37,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is an invasive, moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma located in the tongue, with a size of 2.0 X 1.5 cm on the surface and 1.2 cm in depth.
2. The tumor has focal perineural invasion, but all margins are free of tumor.
3. There is metastatic squamous cell carcinoma present in 1 of 2 lymph nodes in the left modified neck dissection.
4. There is also a soft tissue mass with irregular borders and gray-white cut surface infiltrating through soft tissue, located 4 and 7 cm from the superior soft tissue resection margin, which is a metastatic lesion.

Based on the AJCC staging system, the primary tumor (T) is classified as T2 (tumor > 2 cm but ≤ 4 cm in greatest dimension). The presence of metastatic disease in the lymph nodes (N) is classified as N1 (metastasis in a single ipsilateral lymph node, ≥ 3 cm in greatest dimension). The presence of metastatic disease in the soft tissue (M) is classified as M1 (distant metastasis).

Therefore, the overall stage is Stage IV, as it involves distant metastasis (M1).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IV}"
38,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the primary tumor (pT), regional lymph nodes (pN), and distant metastasis (pM).

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The primary tumor (pT) is classified as pT3, as it measures more than 4 cm in greatest dimension.
* The regional lymph nodes (pN) are classified as pN2b, as there are metastases in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes, none more than 6 cm in greatest dimension.
* There is no distant metastasis (pM).

According to the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 7th edition, 2010, the stage is determined by the combination of pT, pN, and pM. In this case, the stage is:

pT3 pN2b pM0

Therefore, the answer is:

(C) Stage III"
39,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the primary tumor (pT), regional lymph nodes (pN), and distant metastasis (pM).

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The primary tumor (pT) is classified as pT4a, which indicates that the tumor has invaded the bone (mandible).
* The regional lymph nodes (pN) are classified as pNO, which means that no tumor is present in the 44 regional lymph nodes examined.
* The distant metastasis (pM) is classified as pMX, which means that the presence or absence of distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Based on the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a pT4a classification and no regional lymph node involvement (pNO) would correspond to Stage IVa. However, since the distant metastasis (pM) is unknown (pMX), we cannot confirm the presence of distant metastasis, which is a key factor in determining Stage IV.

Therefore, considering the available information, the most accurate stage would be Stage III, as the tumor has invaded the bone (pT4a) but there is no evidence of regional lymph node involvement (pNO) or distant metastasis (pMX).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
40,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor size is 5 cm, which is a significant factor in determining the T stage. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual, a tumor size of 5 cm corresponds to a T3 stage (T1: ≤2 cm, T2: >2 cm but ≤4 cm, T3: >4 cm but ≤7 cm, T4: >7 cm).

2. The tumor is localized, with no evidence of distant metastases (M0). The presence of venous invasion is not a factor in determining the M stage.

3. There are six lymph nodes in the fatty tissue from the right side, but they have a normal morphological structure, indicating no lymph node involvement (N0).

4. Based on the T3 stage and N0 stage, we can determine the overall stage. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual, a T3N0M0 corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
41,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions multiple biopsies and resections, including the mandible, upper lip, floor of mouth, and buccal mucosa.
2. The tumor is described as poorly differentiated squamous carcinoma in the periosteum of the mandible, with invasion into the bone.
3. The report also mentions perineural invasion and questionable lymphatics.
4. The margins of resection are free of tumor, but there is focal moderate dysplasia at the margin.
5. The tumor size is not explicitly stated, but the report describes a 1.5 cm ulcerated lesion on the buccal mucosa.

Based on the AJCC staging system for oral cavity cancer, we can determine the stage as follows:

* T stage: The tumor is described as invasive and poorly differentiated, with invasion into the bone. This corresponds to a T4a tumor, which is a tumor that invades the cortical bone, inferior alveolar nerve, or floor of the mouth.
* N stage: There is no clear evidence of lymph node involvement, so we assume N0.
* M stage: There is no evidence of distant metastases, so we assume M0.

According to the AJCC staging system, a T4a tumor with N0 and M0 corresponds to Stage IVA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IVA}"
42,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The diagnosis is moderately-differentiated invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the right tongue, with invasion into the deep tongue muscles and no invasion into the mandible.
2. The tumor size is 5.0 cm in greatest dimension, and all margins are negative.
3. There is no lymph node involvement (pNo) based on the examination of 16 lymph nodes.
4. The tumor has invaded the deep tongue muscles, which corresponds to a T4a classification.

According to the AJCC staging system, a T4a classification corresponds to a Stage IVA (pT4a, pNo).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IVA}"
43,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, invasion, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The tumor size is 3.4 cm in largest dimension, which corresponds to T2 (Tumor more than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension).
* The tumor has invaded to a depth of 1.4 cm, which does not affect the T stage.
* There is no lymph node involvement, as all lymph nodes from levels I to IV are negative for tumor (0/6, 0/10, 0/18, and 0/9, respectively).
* There is no mention of distant metastasis.

According to the AJCC staging system, a T2 tumor with no lymph node involvement and no distant metastasis corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
44,"## Answer

The patient's pathology report indicates that the tumor is an invasive squamous cell carcinoma, moderately differentiated, measuring 3.0 cm in greatest dimension, involving the bilateral inferior epiglottis and extending through the epiglottis into the pre-epiglottic space. The thyroid cartilage is not present.

The report also states that 19 lymph nodes from the left levels 2, 3, and 4, 5 lymph nodes from the right level 2, 1 lymph node from the left level 1, and 11 lymph nodes from the supraglottic larynx were dissected and found to be negative for malignancy.

Based on this information, the tumor is classified as T3 (tumor > 4 cm or invades adjacent structures) and N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis). The M category is not specified in the report, but it is assumed to be MX (distant metastasis cannot be assessed) since there is no mention of distant metastasis.

According to the AJCC staging system, a T3N0MX tumor corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
