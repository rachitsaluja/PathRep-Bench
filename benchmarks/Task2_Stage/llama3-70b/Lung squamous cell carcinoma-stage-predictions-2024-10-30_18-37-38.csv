From the pathology report, we can identify the following key features:

1. The tumor is a squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, with a maximum diameter of 6.3 cm.
2. The tumor invades the visceral pleura and parietal pericardium, but not the chest wall or mediastinum.
3. There is vascular invasion present.
4. The tumor has metastasized to 3 out of 10 lymph nodes (pN1).

According to the AJCC 6th Edition staging system, a tumor with these features would be classified as:

* pT3: The tumor is larger than 5 cm and invades the visceral pleura and parietal pericardium.
* pN1: The tumor has metastasized to 1-3 lymph nodes.
* pMX: The presence of distant metastases cannot be assessed.

Therefore, the overall stage would be Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
1,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions a 1.1 cm moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in the lung, which is T1a according to the AJCC 8th edition staging system (tumors ≤ 1 cm in size).

2. The tumor invades the overlying pleura, which is classified as PL1 (tumor invades visceral pleura). This does not affect the T stage.

3. There is no lymphovascular invasion.

4. The report mentions a benign intrapulmonary lymph node, negative for carcinoma, which means N0 (no regional lymph node metastases).

5. The margin of resection is negative for carcinoma, indicating R0 resection (no residual tumor).

6. The report also mentions a segment of the 6th rib resection, which is negative for carcinoma. This suggests that the tumor has invaded the rib, which is classified as M1b (distant metastasis to bone).

However, the clinical history and pre-operative diagnosis mention a lung nodule in the right lung, and the tumor shows histologic similarity to the patient's prior left upper lobe carcinoma. This suggests that the rib metastasis might be a result of the previous carcinoma, rather than the current lung nodule.

Considering the above points, the AJCC stage of the cancer would be Stage I (T1a, N0, M0), as the rib metastasis is likely related to the previous carcinoma.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
2,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor is a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, 27 mm in maximal dimension, located in the right upper lobe.
2. The tumor shows blood vessel and perineural invasion, but no lymphatic permeation is seen.
3. There is no definite pleural invasion identified, and the tumor is clear of the bronchial margin.
4. Hilar lymph node metastases are present, indicating that the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes.

Based on the TNM staging system, we can assign the following values:

* T: The tumor is 27 mm in size, which corresponds to T1 (tumor ≤ 3 cm in greatest dimension).
* N: The presence of hilar lymph node metastases corresponds to N1 (metastasis in ipsilateral peribronchial and/or hilar lymph nodes).
* M: There is no evidence of distant metastases, so M0 (no distant metastases).

Therefore, the overall stage is T1N1M0, which corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
3,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the left lung, and it measures 4.5 X 3.5 X 2.0cm. The tumor involves the pleura and focally extends to the inked pleural margin.

2. The bronchial margin is negative for tumor, indicating that the tumor has not invaded the bronchus.

3. There is no vascular invasion, as the vascular margin is negative for tumor.

4. The tumor is a Grade II-III squamous carcinoma of the lung.

5. The lymph nodes are negative for tumor in all levels, including level 9, level 10, level 5, and level 7.

Based on the above information, we can determine the T, N, and M stages as follows:

* T stage: The tumor is T2a, as it measures more than 3cm but less than 5cm in greatest dimension.
* N stage: The N stage is N0, as all lymph nodes are negative for tumor.
* M stage: There is no evidence of distant metastasis, so the M stage is M0.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2a, N0, M0 tumor corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
4,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to analyze the pathology report and identify the key features that affect staging.

1. **Primary Tumor (T)**: The tumor size is 3.7 x 2.8 x 2.8 cm, which corresponds to a T2 tumor (tumors > 3 cm but ≤ 5 cm in greatest dimension).
2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N)**: The report shows that one out of ten peribronchial lymph nodes is positive for metastasis (N1: Ipsilateral Hilar and/or Peribronchial). There is no involvement of contralateral mediastinal/hilar, scalene, or supraclavicular lymph nodes (N3).
3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: There is no evidence of distant metastasis (M X).

Based on these findings, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* T2 (primary tumor size)
* N1 (lymph node involvement)
* M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC staging system, a T2N1M0 corresponds to **Stage IIA**.

However, since the options provided do not include Stage IIA, we need to consider the closest match. Between Stage II and Stage III, Stage II is a better fit, as it typically corresponds to a T2N1M0 or T3N0M0, which is closer to the patient's pathology report.

Therefore, the answer is:

{""stage"" : Stage II}"
5,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor type is squamous cell carcinoma, and the histologic grade is moderately differentiated.
2. The tumor size is 2.4 cm, which corresponds to T1b (tumor 2-3 cm in greatest dimension).
3. The surgical margins are all free of tumor, and there is no direct extension of the tumor.
4. Lymphatic and venous invasions are absent.
5. A total of 7 lymph nodes were examined, and none of them were involved with cancer (pNO).
6. The tumor approaches but does not involve the visceral pleura.

Based on these findings, the TNM staging is pT1b, pNO, and pMX (metastasis cannot be assessed).

According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor with T1b, N0, and M0 corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
6,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor (pT) is classified as pT2a, which means the tumor is > 3 cm and < 5 cm in greatest dimension, surrounded by lung or visceral pleura, without bronchoscopic evidence of invasion in the main bronchus.
2. The regional lymph nodes (pN) are classified as pNO, which means there is no regional lymph node metastasis.
3. There is no mention of distant metastasis (pM), so it is not applicable.

According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a pT2a classification and pNO lymph nodes would correspond to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
7,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumour size is 45 mm in diameter, which corresponds to T2a (tumour > 3 cm but ≤ 5 cm).
2. There is no pleural invasion, lymphatic invasion, vascular invasion, or perineural invasion.
3. The tumour is clear of the bronchial resection margin, with only focal mild and moderate squamous dysplasia at the margin.
4. The peribronchial lymph nodes, left hilar lymph node, and mediastinal lymph node are not involved by tumour, indicating N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis).

Based on these findings, the pathological stage is pT2a NO. According to the AJCC staging system, a T2a tumour with no nodal involvement (N0) corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
8,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the Cancer.

1. The report mentions a primary tumor in the right lower lobe lung, measuring 5 X 4.5 X 2.6 cm, which is a significant size. However, it does not extend through the pleura, indicating that it has not invaded the visceral pleura or the chest wall.

2. The bronchial margin is negative for tumor, which means that the tumor has not invaded the bronchus.

3. Multiple intrapulmonary peribronchial lymph nodes are negative for tumor, indicating that there is no lymph node involvement within the lung.

4. The report also mentions that multiple superior and inferior mediastinal lymph nodes, as well as N1 lymph nodes, are negative for tumor. This suggests that there is no lymph node involvement in the mediastinum or the N1 region.

Considering these factors, we can conclude that the tumor is confined to the lung and has not invaded the pleura, bronchus, or lymph nodes. According to the AJCC staging system, this corresponds to a T2 tumor (since it is larger than 3 cm but not larger than 5 cm) with no nodal involvement (N0).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
9,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The patient has a squamous cell carcinoma of the left upper lobe, poorly differentiated, with a tumor size of 3.2 cm (T2).
2. There is no vascular invasion or perineural invasion.
3. The bronchial margin is free of tumor.
4. The tumor involves the visceral pleura (PL1).
5. There is no in situ carcinoma.
6. The lymph node status is as follows: peribronchial: 0/8, indicating no metastatic lymph nodes in the peribronchial region.
7. Multiple mediastinal lymph nodes were examined (Levels 5, 6, 7, and 11), and all were benign, with no evidence of metastatic disease.

Based on the above findings, the patient has a T2 tumor (size > 3 cm) with visceral pleural involvement (PL1) and no lymph node metastases (N0). Therefore, the AJCC stage of the cancer is Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
10,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Primary tumor (pT): The report states that the primary tumor is pT1b, which means the tumor is 2 cm or less in size and has not invaded the visceral pleura.

2. Regional lymph nodes (pN): The report states that the regional lymph nodes are pNO, which means there is no evidence of tumor in the lymph nodes.

3. Distant metastasis (pM): The report states that distant metastasis is not applicable, which means there is no evidence of distant metastasis.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage of the cancer. Since the primary tumor is pT1b and there is no evidence of regional lymph node involvement (pNO) or distant metastasis, the AJCC stage is Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
11,"## Answer

The patient's pathology report indicates a primary lung tumor with the following characteristics:

* Tumor location: Right upper lobe
* Tumor size: 4.5 cm (maximum dimension) and 3.5 cm (minor dimension)
* Gross satellites: 1
* Tumor type: Invasive squamous carcinoma
* Histologic grade: Moderately differentiated (G2)
* Visceral pleural invasion: Present
* Angiolymphatic invasion: Present
* Tumor necrosis: > 50%
* Surgical margin involvement: No
* N1 lymph nodes: 1 out of 12 positive
* N2 lymph nodes: 0 out of 4 positive
* M stage: pMX (cannot be assessed)

Based on the AJCC staging system, the patient's tumor is classified as:

* T stage: pT4 (due to visceral pleural invasion and angiolymphatic invasion)
* N stage: pN1 (due to 1 out of 12 positive N1 lymph nodes)
* M stage: pMX (cannot be assessed)

Therefore, the patient's AJCC stage is Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
12,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report describes a lung wedge excision with a 2.3 x 2 x 1.8 cm mass abutting but not directly invading the pleura. This suggests that the tumor is confined to the lung and has not invaded the pleura, which is a key factor in determining the T stage.

2. The T stage is determined by the size of the tumor and its invasion of surrounding structures. Based on the report, the tumor is 2.3 cm in size, which corresponds to a T1 stage (tumors ≤ 3 cm in size).

3. The report also mentions that multiple lymph nodes were excised, including inferior mediastinal, aortic, and N1 lymph nodes. However, all of these lymph nodes were negative for tumor, indicating that there is no nodal involvement. This corresponds to an N0 stage.

4. Since there is no mention of distant metastases in the report, the M stage is M0.

5. Combining the T, N, and M stages, we get a stage of T1N0M0, which corresponds to Stage I according to the AJCC staging system.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the left lung, and its size is 2.5 cm (PT2).
2. The pleura, bronchial, and vascular margins are negative for tumor, indicating no local invasion.
3. There is no involvement of the peribronchial lymph nodes (0/9), which suggests N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis).
4. The tumor involves the left main bronchus, but this does not affect the T or N stage.
5. There is no evidence of distant metastasis (M0) based on the report.

According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a size of 2.5 cm (PT2), no regional lymph node metastasis (N0), and no distant metastasis (M0) corresponds to Stage IIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
14,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions the tumor size as 4.2999999999999998 cm, which is not a critical factor in determining the stage in this case.
2. The histology is Squamous carcinoma, and the grade/differentiation is III, which indicates a moderately to poorly differentiated tumor. However, this information is not directly related to the staging.
3. The Pathological T (pT) stage is T2a, which means the tumor is larger than 3 cm but not larger than 5 cm, and it has not invaded the main bronchus or the visceral pleura.
4. The Pathological N (pN) stage is N1, indicating that the cancer has spread to the ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes, and/or intrapulmonary nodes involved by direct extension of the primary tumor.
5. The Clinical M (cM) stage is M0, indicating that there is no distant metastasis.

Based on the AJCC staging system, a T2a tumor with N1 nodes and M0 distant metastasis corresponds to Stage IIIA.

Therefore, the answer is -

15,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor size is 3 X 3 X 3.5 cm, which is a significant factor in determining the T stage (primary tumor size). According to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual, a tumor size of 3-4 cm corresponds to a T1b stage.

2. There is no information about the involvement of lymph nodes (N stage) or distant metastases (M stage) in the report. This lack of information makes it difficult to determine the N and M stages.

3. Since the report only provides information about the primary tumor size, we can only determine the T stage (T1b). Without information about the N and M stages, we cannot determine the overall stage of the cancer.

4. Considering the available information, the most likely answer is (A) Stage I, as it is the earliest stage that includes a T1b tumor. However, please note that this answer is based on incomplete information and may not be accurate.

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (T)**: The tumor size is 4.2 x 4.0 x 2.3 cm, and it invades the visceral pleura. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual, this corresponds to a T2a tumor (tumor > 3 cm but ≤ 5 cm in greatest dimension, and invades the visceral pleura).

2. **Lymph Node Status (N)**: Only one peribronchial lymph node was received, and it did not contain metastatic carcinoma. Therefore, the lymph node status is NO (no regional lymph node metastases).

3. **Distant Metastases (M)**: There is no mention of distant metastases in the pathology report.

Based on the above information, the pTNM stage is pT2a NO, which corresponds to **Stage II** according to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual.

18,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions ""Squamous cell carcinoma"" as the histological description, which indicates the type of cancer.
2. The TNM Stage is provided as T2, N0, M0.
   - T2 indicates the tumor is larger than 3 cm but not larger than 5 cm, or it's a tumor that's 5 cm or smaller and has grown into the bronchus, but not into the main bronchus near the carina.
   - N0 indicates there is no regional lymph node metastasis.
   - M0 indicates there is no distant metastasis.

Based on the TNM Stage, we can determine the overall stage of the cancer.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2, N0, M0 corresponds to Stage I.

19,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor size is 57 mm, which corresponds to T3 (tumor > 5 cm).
2. The tumor invades the pericardium, but not through to the inner mesothelial-lined surface, which is still considered T3.
3. There is no evidence of pleural invasion on the opposite aspect of the specimen to the adherent pericardium.
4. Vascular, lymphatic, and perineural invasion are present, but this does not affect the T stage.
5. The bronchial resection margin is clear of malignancy.
6. There are no lymph node metastases (NO).

Based on the above information, the pathological stage is T3 NO. Since there is no evidence of distant metastases (M0), the overall stage is Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
20,"## Answer

From the pathology report, we can identify the key features of the cancer:

1. The tumor is a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma located in the apical segment of the right lower lobe, measuring 52 mm in diameter.
2. The tumor invades the parietal pleura, but the soft tissue resection margin is clear of malignancy.
3. There is extensive vascular invasion present.
4. Focal perineural invasion is present.
5. No lymphatic invasion is found.
6. Metastatic carcinoma is present in the No. 11 lymph node (N1).

Based on these features, we can determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

The primary tumor (T) is classified as T3 because it invades the parietal pleura.

The lymph node status (N) is classified as N1 because there is metastatic carcinoma in one of the lymph nodes (No. 11 lymph node).

There is no evidence of distant metastasis (M0).

Therefore, the AJCC stage of the cancer is Stage III (T3 N1 M0).

Therefore, the answer is -

2. There is no evidence of visceral pleural or angiolymphatic invasion.
3. One of the 15 N1 lymph nodes is positive for metastases, which corresponds to an N1 lymph node status (N1: metastasis in ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes).
4. There is no evidence of metastases in the N2 lymph nodes.
5. There is no evidence of distant metastases (M0).

Based on the TNM classification, the patient's cancer stage is T2N1M0, which corresponds to Stage IIA according to the AJCC 8th edition staging system.

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor (T) is described as a moderately differentiated keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma, 11.0 cm in size, with negative visceral pleural, bronchial, and vascular margins. This corresponds to a pT2 tumor, which is a tumor larger than 5 cm but not more than 7 cm in greatest dimension.

2. The lymph node status (N) is described as N1, which means there is metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes, and/or intrapulmonary nodes, including involvement by direct extension.

3. There is no mention of distant metastasis (M) in the report.

According to the AJCC staging system, a pT2 N1 tumor corresponds to Stage IIA.

However, the report also mentions that one of the lymph nodes (Level 10) is positive for microscopic metastatic carcinoma, which suggests that the tumor has spread to mediastinal lymph nodes. This would upgrade the N stage to N2, which corresponds to Stage IIIA.

24,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the cancer:

1. Tumor size: 3 X 2 X 2 cm - This information is not sufficient to determine the T stage (primary tumor size) as the AJCC staging system requires the tumor size to be categorized as T1 (<3 cm), T2 (≥3 cm but ≤5 cm), T3 (>5 cm but ≤7 cm), or T4 (>7 cm).
2. Histologic type: Squamous cell carcinoma - This information is not relevant for determining the AJCC stage.
3. Histologic grade: Poorly differentiated - This information is not relevant for determining the AJCC stage.
4. Tumor extent: Not specified - This information is not sufficient to determine the T stage.
5. Other tumor nodules: Not specified - This information is not sufficient to determine the T stage.
6. Lymph nodes: 3/6 positive for metastasis (Intrathoracical 3/6) - This indicates that there is lymph node involvement, which is a key factor in determining the N stage (lymph node involvement). With 3 out of 6 lymph nodes positive for metastasis, the N stage is likely N2 (involvement of ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes).

Based on the available information, we can conclude that the patient has a T stage that is unknown (TX) and an N stage of N2. According to the AJCC staging system, a patient with TXN2 would be classified as Stage III.

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer:

1. **Tumor size**: The tumor size is 8x8x8cm, which is a significant size, but it doesn't directly determine the stage.
2. **Tumor extent**: The tumor extends to the visceral pleura, which indicates a T2 or higher classification (T2: tumor invades visceral pleura).
3. **Lymph nodes**: 8 out of 10 lymph nodes are positive for metastasis, which is a significant number. This indicates an N2 classification (N2: metastasis to ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes).
4. **Distant metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report.

Based on the above information, we can determine the TNM classification as follows:

* T: T2 (tumor invades visceral pleura)
* N: N2 (metastasis to ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes)
* M: M0 (no distant metastasis)

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor is a squamous cell carcinoma, moderately differentiated, with a maximal tumor size of 7.7 cm. This corresponds to a T2 tumor, as it is greater than 3 cm in greatest dimension.
2. The visceral pleura is invaded, which is also consistent with a T2 tumor.
3. There is no regional lymph node metastasis, as all peribronchial lymph nodes (6 lobar and 1 segmental) are negative for malignancy. This corresponds to an N0 node status.
4. The surgical resection margins are negative for malignancy, and the distance of invasive carcinoma from the closest margin is 3.5 cm.
5. There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report.

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer:

1. The primary tumor is a 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm mass located 1.8 cm away from the bronchial margin, which is negative for tumor. This suggests that the tumor is confined to the lung and has not invaded the bronchial margin.

2. The report mentions that multiple (10) intrapulmonary peribronchial lymph nodes are negative for tumor. This indicates that the tumor has not spread to the intrapulmonary lymph nodes.

3. The report also mentions that the visceral pleura is negative for tumor. This suggests that the tumor has not invaded the visceral pleura.

4. The report mentions that the soft tissue, left hilar region, excision shows Grade 4 non-small cell carcinoma with squamous features. This suggests that the tumor has spread to the hilar region, which is a regional lymph node station.

5. The report mentions that multiple lymph nodes from the superior mediastinal, aortic, inferior mediastinal, and left lower lobe bronchus are negative for tumor. This suggests that the tumor has not spread to these lymph node stations.

Based on the above findings, we can determine the T, N, and M stages as follows:

* T stage: The primary tumor is 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm in size and has not invaded the bronchial margin or visceral pleura. Therefore, the T stage is T2a (tumor 2-3 cm in greatest dimension).
* N stage: The tumor has spread to the hilar region (N1), but not to the mediastinal or other lymph node stations.
* M stage: There is no evidence of distant metastasis.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2a, N1, M0 tumor corresponds to Stage IIIA.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual, a pT3, pN1, and pMX corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
31,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor site is the lung, and the histologic type is squamous cell carcinoma, which is a type of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
2. The tumor size is 3 X 2.5 X 2 cm, which is a significant factor in determining the T stage (primary tumor size).
3. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a tumor size of 3 cm or less corresponds to a T1 stage.
4. However, the report does not provide information about the lymph nodes (N stage) or distant metastases (M stage), which are crucial in determining the overall stage.
5. In the absence of information about lymph node involvement or distant metastases, we cannot determine the N or M stage.
6. Based on the available information, we can only determine the T stage, which is T1.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
32,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor is located in the left lower lobe (LLL) of the lung, and the greatest dimension is 4.0 cm. This corresponds to a pT2 tumor, as it is greater than 3 cm in greatest dimension.

2. The lymph node status is pN1, as there is metastasis in one of the nine lymph nodes in the left lobar region (12L).

3. There is no evidence of distant metastasis (pMX: Cannot be assessed).

4. The tumor has invaded small venous vessels (venous invasion present), but there is no evidence of pleural invasion or direct extension of the tumor.

Based on the pT2 and pN1 classifications, the AJCC stage of the cancer is Stage IIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IIA}"
33,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the primary tumor (pT), regional lymph nodes (pN), and distant metastasis (pM).

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The primary tumor (pT) is classified as pT2a, which means the tumor is > 3 cm and < 5 cm in greatest dimension, surrounded by lung or visceral pleura, without bronchoscopic evidence of invasion in the main bronchus.
* The regional lymph nodes (pN) are classified as pNO, which means there is no regional lymph node metastasis.
* There is no mention of distant metastasis (pM), so it is assumed to be pM0, which means there is no distant metastasis.

Based on these findings, the AJCC stage of the cancer is Stage II (T2a, N0, M0).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
34,"## Answer

From the pathology report, we can identify the following key features:

1. The primary tumor (pT) measures 5.5 cm in dimension and extends through the pleura but is not identified at the outer surface of the specimen.
2. The margins of resection are negative for tumor.
3. There is no vessel invasion.
4. The regional lymph nodes (pN) are pNO, indicating no regional lymph node metastases.
5. The distant metastasis (pM) is pMx, which means it cannot be assessed.

Based on these features, we can determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

The primary tumor (pT) is T2, as it measures more than 4 cm in dimension. The absence of regional lymph node metastases (pN0) and the inability to assess distant metastases (pMx) do not affect the stage.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
35,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to analyze the pathology report and identify the key factors that influence staging.

1. **Primary Tumor (T)**: The tumor size is 4.9 x 4.7 x 4.5 cm, which is a significant size. The tumor invades through the pleura into the chest wall, which is a key feature of a T3 tumor.
2. **Lymph Node Status (N)**: All lymph nodes biopsied (R4, Level 7, L4, R2, and Level 10 and 11) are negative for malignancy, indicating no lymph node involvement (N0).
3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: There is no evidence of distant metastasis in the report.

Based on these factors, the TNM classification is pT3 pNO PL3.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a pT3 tumor with no lymph node involvement (N0) and no distant metastasis (M0) corresponds to **Stage III**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
36,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the Cancer:

1. The primary tumor (T) is described as a 4.5 x 4 x 3 cm intrabronchial and parenchymal hilar mass, which is a significant size. However, there is no mention of invasion into the pleura or chest wall, so it's likely a T2 or T3.

2. The bronchial margin is involved by extensive in situ carcinoma, but this does not affect the T stage.

3. The lymph nodes (N) are involved by metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in multiple stations, including intrapulmonary peribronchial (6 of 14), aortopulmonary (2 of 2), and anterior mediastinal (1 of 2) lymph nodes. This indicates a significant nodal involvement, likely N3.

4. There is no mention of distant metastases (M) in the report.

Based on the above analysis, the tumor is likely T2 or T3, N3, and M0. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, this corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
37,"## Answer

From the pathology report, we can identify the following key features:

1. The tumor is a poorly differentiated large cell carcinoma with squamoid features, measuring 3.5 cm in greatest dimension.
2. The tumor is predominantly endobronchial, but with pulmonary parenchymal invasion.
3. The closest inked pleural margin is negative for malignancy.
4. The bronchus and blood vessels at the surgical margin are negative for malignancy, and there is no lymphovascular invasion.
5. No hilar lymph nodes are identified with malignancy.

Based on these features, we can determine the T stage as T2a (tumor 3.5 cm in greatest dimension, with pulmonary parenchymal invasion, but without invasion of the visceral pleura or into the main bronchus).

Since there is no lymph node involvement (N0), the N stage is N0.

The M stage is M0, as there is no evidence of distant metastases.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2a, N0, M0 corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
38,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The patient has a moderately to poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the right lower lobe lung, measuring 2.9 x 2.5 x 1.8 cm.
2. The tumor extends subpleurally but not to the pleural surface, and the bronchial margin is free of tumor.
3. There is no vascular invasion or perineural invasion identified.
4. The lymph node status is as follows: all lymph nodes examined (Level VII mediastinal, Level VII mediastinal #2, and Right mediastinal lymph node level XI) are benign, with no metastatic nodes identified.

Based on the above information, we can determine the T, N, and M stages as follows:

* T stage: T2 (tumor size is 2.9 cm, and it extends subpleurally but not to the pleural surface)
* N stage: N0 (no metastatic nodes identified in any of the lymph nodes examined)
* M stage: M0 (no distant metastases identified)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2N0M0 corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
39,"## Answer

From the pathology report, we can identify the TNM classification as pT2 pNO pMX R0, which corresponds to Stage IB.

Here's the breakdown:

* pT2: The primary tumor is larger than 3 cm but not larger than 5 cm, or it's a tumor of any size that invades the visceral pleura (the lining surrounding the lungs). In this case, the tumor is 8.5 cm in size, but it does not invade the visceral pleura.
* pNO: There is no evidence of regional lymph node metastasis.
* pMX: The presence of distant metastasis cannot be assessed.
* R0: The resection margins are tumor-free.

According to the AJCC staging system, a pT2 pNO pMX R0 classification corresponds to Stage IB.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IB""}"
40,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma in the right lung, with multiple nodules.
2. The tumor size is described as 5.5 cm x 4.0 cm x 3.5 cm, which is greater than 5 cm, but not larger than 7 cm.
3. There is no evidence of visceral pleura invasion, lymphovascular invasion, or extranodal extension.
4. The bronchial and vascular margins of resection are negative for carcinoma.
5. The report mentions separate tumor nodules in the same lobe, which is a key factor in determining the T stage.
6. The T stage is classified as pT3 due to the presence of separate tumor nodules in the same lobe.
7. The N stage is classified as pN0, as all 8 lymph nodes examined are negative for metastatic carcinoma.
8. There is no evidence of distant metastasis (pM).

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* T stage: pT3 (due to separate tumor nodules in the same lobe)
* N stage: pN0 (no lymph node metastasis)
* M stage: pM0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a pT3 N0 M0 classification corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
41,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Tumor size**: The tumor size is 6.5 x 5.5 x 5.5 cm, which is a significant size. However, the AJCC staging system for lung cancer does not solely rely on tumor size.

2. **Lymph nodes**: The report states that 0 out of 6 lymph nodes are positive for metastasis. This indicates that there is no lymph node involvement, which is a crucial factor in determining the stage.

3. **Tumor extent**: The report does not specify the tumor extent, which could be a crucial factor in determining the stage. However, we can infer from the lack of lymph node involvement and the tumor size that the tumor is likely localized.

4. **Distant metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, which suggests that the cancer has not spread to other parts of the body.

Considering these factors, we can conclude that the cancer is likely localized to the lung, with no lymph node involvement and no distant metastasis.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
42,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size (T), lymph node involvement (N), and distant metastasis (M).

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The tumor size is 4.5 cm (pT3), which is a significant factor in determining the stage.
* There is no lymph node involvement (NO), as all lymph nodes examined were negative for malignancy.
* There is no distant metastasis (Mx), as the report does not mention any metastases to other organs or tissues.

Based on the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a size of 4.5 cm (T3) and no lymph node involvement (N0) would correspond to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
43,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor type is squamous cell carcinoma, which is a type of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
2. The tumor size is 2x2x1.8cm, which corresponds to a T1 tumor (≤ 3 cm in greatest dimension).
3. The bronchial margin is negative, indicating that the tumor does not involve the main stem bronchus.
4. The visceral pleural margin is also negative, indicating that the tumor does not invade the visceral pleura.
5. There is no angiolymphatic invasion or perineural invasion.
6. The hilar lymph nodes (peribronchial) are negative (0/2), indicating that there is no nodal involvement (N0).

Based on these findings, the pathologic stage is pT1N0, which corresponds to Stage I according to the AJCC 8th edition staging system for NSCLC.

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor (T) is described as a 3.5 cm invasive, poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma in the left lower lobe of the lung. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a tumor size of 3.5 cm corresponds to T2a.

2. The pleura and inked resection margin are negative, indicating no invasion of the visceral pleura (PL0) and no residual tumor at the resection margin (R0).

3. The lymph node (N) status is reported as N2, as one lymph node (level 9L) is negative for metastatic carcinoma (0/1). However, the presence of a lymph node at level 9L suggests that the tumor has spread to the mediastinal lymph nodes, which corresponds to N2.

4. There is no mention of distant metastases (M) in the report.

Based on the above information, the TNM staging is T2a N2 M0.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2a N2 M0 corresponds to Stage IIIA.

46,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The tumor size is 5.0 cm, which corresponds to T2a (tumor > 3 cm but ≤ 5 cm).
* The tumor has invaded the mainstem bronchus and has perineural invasion, but the bronchial margin is free of tumor.
* There is metastatic carcinoma in regional lymph nodes, with 6/9 peribronchial lymph nodes and 1/1 parenchymal lymph node involved.
* There is no evidence of distant metastasis.

Based on the TNM classification, the tumor can be staged as:

* T2a: Tumor > 3 cm but ≤ 5 cm
* N2: Metastasis in ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes
* M0: No distant metastasis

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, the stage corresponding to T2a, N2, and M0 is Stage IIIA.

   - pNO: There is no regional lymph node involvement.
   - pMX: The distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Based on the TNM staging, the patient has a T1a primary tumor, no regional lymph node involvement, and no distant metastasis. This corresponds to Stage I disease.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
49,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer:

1. The report mentions ""THE CARCINOMA INVOLVES THE PLEURAL SURFACE"", which indicates that the tumor has invaded the visceral pleura (T2).
2. The report states that ""ALL OTHER SURGICAL MARGINS OF RESECTION ARE NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR"", which means that the tumor has not invaded the surgical margins (R0 resection).
3. The report mentions that ""ONE (1) HILAR LYMPH NODE AND ASSOCIATED FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR"", which indicates that the hilar lymph node is negative for tumor (N0).
4. The report also mentions that two other lymph nodes (Station 5 and L11) are negative for tumor, which further supports the N0 status.

Based on the above information, we can determine the T, N, and M stages as follows:

* T stage: T2 (tumor invades the visceral pleura)
* N stage: N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis)
* M stage: M0 (no distant metastasis, not mentioned in the report)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2N0M0 corresponds to Stage II.

50,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions a poorly-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma in the left upper lobe of the lung, with a maximal dimension of 37mm.
2. There is no evidence of pleural invasion, blood vessel invasion, lymphatic permeation, or perineural permeation.
3. The tumor is at least 25mm deep to the closest pleural surface and at least 30mm from the bronchial resection margin.
4. The peribronchial lymph nodes show sinus histiocytosis and contain carbon pigment, but no metastases are present.
5. The summary section of the report states the pathological stage as T2N0Mx.

Based on the AJCC staging system, a T2 tumor is defined as a tumor larger than 3cm but not larger than 5cm in greatest dimension. Since the tumor in this case is 37mm (less than 5cm), it meets the criteria for a T2 tumor.

The N0 designation indicates that there are no regional lymph node metastases, which is consistent with the report's finding of no metastases in the peribronchial lymph nodes.

The Mx designation indicates that distant metastases cannot be assessed.

Therefore, the overall stage of the cancer is Stage II, which corresponds to a T2N0Mx designation.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
51,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor size is 4 X 3 X 3.5 cm, which is a significant size, but we need to consider other factors to determine the stage.
2. The histologic type is squamous cell carcinoma, which is a type of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This information is important for staging, but it doesn't directly impact the stage.
3. The histologic grade is moderately differentiated, which may affect prognosis but not the stage.
4. The tumor extent is not specified, which means we can't determine if the tumor has invaded surrounding structures or not.
5. There is no information about other tumor nodules, lymph nodes, lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, or margins, which are all important factors in determining the stage.

Given the limited information, we can only rely on the tumor size to determine the stage. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a tumor size of 4 X 3 X 3.5 cm corresponds to a T2a tumor (tumors >3 cm but ≤5 cm in greatest dimension).

Since there is no information about nodal involvement or metastases, we can assume that the patient has no nodal involvement (N0) and no distant metastases (M0).

Therefore, the patient's stage is likely Stage I, as the tumor is localized to the lung and has not invaded surrounding structures or spread to lymph nodes or distant sites.

Therefore, the answer is -

2. The lymph nodes (N) are involved, with squamous cell carcinoma present in one of the lymph nodes (specimen 8). This indicates N1 disease, as the tumor has spread to ipsilateral peribronchial and/or hilar lymph nodes.

3. There is no evidence of distant metastases (M), as all the lymph nodes examined show reactive changes only, except for one lymph node with squamous cell carcinoma.

Based on the TNM classification, the patient has a T2N1MX cancer. According to the AJCC staging system, this corresponds to Stage IIIA.

Therefore, the answer is -

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor is located in the right lower lobe of the lung, and it's a squamous cell carcinoma.
2. The tumor size is 3.0 X 3.0 X 3.0 cm, which corresponds to a T1b tumor (since it's ≤ 4 cm in greatest dimension).
3. However, the report mentions a ""satellite tumor"" which upgrades the tumor stage to T3.
4. There is no visceral pleural invasion, and the tumor appears confined to the lung.
5. Lymphovascular space invasion is suspected, but not confirmed.
6. The tumor distance from the bronchial margin is 2.0 cm, and from the pleural surface is less than 0.1 cm.
7. No lymph nodes contain metastatic carcinoma (0/2).
