To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the primary tumor (T), lymph node involvement (N), and distant metastasis (M).

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The primary tumor (T) is classified as pT4a, which means the tumor has invaded the hyoid bone and/or thyroid cartilage, and/or has invaded the laryngeal cartilage and/or has extrinsic muscle invasion.
* Lymph node involvement (N) is classified as pN2c, which means there are multiple lymph nodes involved on both sides of the neck, with at least one node larger than 3 cm in greatest dimension.
* There is no evidence of distant metastasis (M), so M is classified as pMx (unknown).

Based on the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a pT4a primary tumor, pN2c lymph node involvement, and pMx distant metastasis would correspond to Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is:

{""stage"" : Stage IV}"
1,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions ""POORLY DIFFERENTIATED SQUAMOUS CARCINOMA INVADING BONE"" in the anterior mandible, which indicates that the tumor has invaded the bone.

2. The report also mentions ""LYMPHATIC AND PERINEURAL INVASION FLOOR OF MOUTH"" and ""TUMOR CLOSE TO MARGIN OF RESECTION"", which suggests that the tumor has invaded the floor of the mouth and is close to the resection margin.

3. However, the report states that the bone margins of resection are free of tumor, and the soft tissue margins are also free of tumor, except for the anterior mucosal margin which has been disrupted.

4. The report also mentions that five lymph nodes were examined, and none of them showed tumor involvement.

Based on these findings, we can determine the T stage as T4, since the tumor has invaded the bone and the floor of the mouth.

The N stage is N0, since none of the lymph nodes showed tumor involvement.

Since there is no mention of distant metastases, the M stage is M0.

According to the AJCC staging system, a T4N0M0 corresponds to Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IV}"
2,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size (T), regional lymph nodes (N), and distant metastasis (M).

From the pathology report, we can extract the following information:

* Tumor size (T): The tumor is 4 cm in greatest dimension, which corresponds to T2 (tumor more than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension).
* Regional lymph nodes (N): There are metastases in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes (pN2b), with focal extranodal extension.
* Distant metastasis (M): There is no evidence of distant metastasis (pMX: cannot be assessed).

Based on the AJCC staging system, the T2 tumor and pN2b lymph nodes correspond to Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IV}"
3,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC Stage of the cancer.

First, we need to identify the primary tumor (T) stage. The report states that the tumor is 1.9 cm in size, and there is no angiolymphatic invasion or perineural invasion. The surgical margins are 1.6 mm to the deep margin and 3 mm to the medial margin, with the remaining margins >1 cm. Based on this information, the primary tumor stage is T1.

Next, we need to determine the nodal (N) stage. The report states that 24 lymph nodes are negative for carcinoma (0/24). This indicates that there is no nodal involvement, so the nodal stage is N0.

Finally, we need to determine the metastasis (M) stage. The report does not mention any distant metastases, so the metastasis stage is M0.

Based on the T1, N0, and M0 stages, the AJCC Pathologic Stage is pT1 pNO, which corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage I}"
4,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (pT)**: The report states that the tumor is 3.5 cm in greatest dimension, which corresponds to pT2 (Tumor more than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension).
2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN)**: The report indicates that there is no regional lymph node metastasis (pN0), as 27 lymph nodes were examined and none were involved.
3. **Distant Metastasis (pM)**: There is no mention of distant metastasis, so pM0.

Based on the AJCC staging system, the stage is determined by the combination of pT, pN, and pM. In this case, we have:

* pT2 (tumor size 3.5 cm)
* pN0 (no lymph node metastasis)
* pM0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC staging system, this corresponds to **Stage II**.

Therefore, the answer is:
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
5,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions ""pT2"", which indicates the primary tumor is of size 2.6 x 2.6 x 1.0 cm, invading the subglottal and supraglottal regions. According to the AJCC staging system, a T2 tumor is larger than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension, and may involve the supraglottis and/or glottis and/or subglottis.

2. The report also mentions ""pNO"", which indicates there is no evidence of regional lymph node metastasis.

3. There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report.

Based on the above information, the tumor is classified as T2N0M0, which corresponds to Stage II according to the AJCC staging system.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
6,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary tumor (T)**: The tumor size is 5.0 x 3.0 cm, and it invades the anterior space, thyroid cartilage, and epiglottic cartilage with extensive perineural invasion. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual, this corresponds to T4a (tumor invades thyroid cartilage, trachea, cricoid cartilage, or cervical esophagus).

2. **Lymph nodes (N)**: There are 5/42 positive lymph nodes on the left side, with macrometastasis (size of large metastatic focus 2.2 cm) and no extracapsular extension. This corresponds to N2b (metastasis in multiple lymph nodes, none larger than 6 cm).

3. **Distant metastasis (M)**: There is no evidence of distant metastasis in the report.

Based on the above, the AJCC stage is determined by combining the T, N, and M categories. In this case, the stage is T4a, N2b, M0.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual, the corresponding stage is **Stage IV**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IV}"
7,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Tumor size and extent**: The tumor size is 4 x 2 cm, which is a significant size, but not explicitly stated as T1, T2, T3, or T4. However, the tumor extent is mentioned as ""Deep muscles of the tongue"", which suggests a T3 tumor (T3: Tumor invades postcricoid area, pre-epiglottic space, paraglottic space, and/or minor thyroid cartilage, thyroid gland, or cervical esophagus).

2. **Lymph node involvement**: The report states that 1/4 lymph nodes are positive for metastasis (Cervical 1/4), which indicates N1 disease (N1: Metastasis in a single ipsilateral lymph node, ≤3 cm in greatest dimension).

3. **Margins and distant metastasis**: The margins are uninvolved, and there is no mention of distant metastasis.

Considering the above factors, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* Tumor (T): T3 (based on tumor extent)
* Lymph nodes (N): N1 (based on lymph node involvement)
* Distant metastasis (M): M0 (no distant metastasis mentioned)

According to the AJCC staging system, a T3N1M0 corresponds to **Stage III**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
8,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* There is metastasis in bilateral lymph nodes (levels I, II, and III on the left side and levels II and III on the right side), with extranodal invasion present. This corresponds to N2c (metastasis in bilateral or contralateral lymph nodes, none more than 6 cm in greatest dimension).
* There is no distant metastasis (pMX: Distant metastasis cannot be assessed).

Based on the TNM classification, the patient's cancer stage is Stage III (T3N2cMX).

Therefore, the answer is -

9,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the right pyriform sinus, measuring 3.5 x 1.5 x 1.1 cm, and has not invaded the bone. This corresponds to a T2 tumor (tumor > 2 cm but ≤ 4 cm in greatest dimension).
2. The report mentions metastatic squamous carcinoma in multiple lymph nodes on both sides of the neck, including levels II, III, and IV. This indicates the presence of nodal metastases (N3).
3. There is no evidence of distant metastases (M0) mentioned in the report.

According to the AJCC staging system, a T2 tumor with N3 nodal metastases and no distant metastases corresponds to Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IV}"
10,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the pharynx, left posterior wall, with a maximum dimension of 4.5 cm. This corresponds to a T2 tumor (T2: Tumor > 2 cm but ≤ 4 cm in greatest dimension).
2. The report mentions lymphovascular invasion, which does not affect the T stage.
3. There are two peritumoral deposits of squamous cell carcinoma, possibly representing two completely replaced lymph nodes. This is considered N3b disease (N3b: Metastasis in a lymph node > 6 cm in greatest dimension).
4. Additionally, there are metastases in 1 of 10 right cervical lymph nodes and 5 of 10 left cervical lymph nodes. This further supports the N3b classification.
5. The margins are free of tumor, and there is no evidence of distant metastases (M0).

Based on the AJCC staging system, a T2 primary tumor with N3b lymph node metastases corresponds to Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IV}"
11,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and metastasis.

From the pathology report, we know that the tumor size is 5.0 cm (greatest dimension), and it is moderately to poorly differentiated. The tumor has infiltrated salivary glands and skeletal muscle, including the tongue.

The lymph node involvement is significant, with metastatic carcinoma present in four of 35 lymph nodes. The largest positive node is 2.5 cm (level III), and three other positive nodes (level IIA, III, and IV) are approximately 1.5 cm, 1.2 cm, and 1.1 cm, respectively. Both level III nodes and the level IIA node have extracapsular extension.

There is no evidence of distant metastasis.

According to the AJCC staging system, the primary tumor (T) is classified as T4a due to the tumor size and invasion of surrounding structures. The lymph node involvement (N) is classified as N2b due to the presence of multiple positive nodes with extracapsular extension.

Therefore, the overall stage is Stage IV.

The answer is - {""stage"" : Stage IV}"
12,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (T)**: The tumor size is 1 x 0 x 1.5 cm, which is relatively small. The tumor is localized to the larynx, and there is no mention of extension to surrounding structures. Therefore, the T stage is likely T1 or T2.

2. **Lymph Nodes (N)**: There is no mention of lymph node involvement or examination, so we cannot determine the N stage from this report.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so we can assume M0.

Considering the above information, the most likely stage is Stage I or Stage II, as the tumor is localized to the larynx and there is no evidence of lymph node involvement or distant metastasis.

However, since the report mentions that ""Endoscopies, figrolaryngoscopy show cancer of the larynx with the involvement of all parts of the organ,"" this suggests that the tumor may be more extensive than initially thought. This could potentially upstage the tumor to T3 or T4, which would correspond to Stage III or Stage IV.

Given the uncertainty, I will choose the most likely answer based on the available information.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
13,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the primary tumor (T), regional lymph nodes (N), and distant metastasis (M).

**Primary Tumor (T):**
The tumor is located in the supraglottis with extension into the glottis, and its greatest dimension is 3.6 cm. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual, a tumor of this size is classified as T2.

**Regional Lymph Nodes (N):**
The pathology report shows metastasis in bilateral lymph nodes, with none larger than 6 cm in greatest dimension. This is classified as N2c.

**Distant Metastasis (M):**
There is no evidence of distant metastasis in the pathology report, so M0.

**AJCC Stage:**
Based on the T, N, and M classifications, the AJCC stage is Stage III (T2N2cM0).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
14,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (pT)**: The report states that the primary tumor is pT4a, which means the tumor has invaded the skin of the cheek and is larger than 4 cm in greatest dimension.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN)**: The report states that 45 regional lymph nodes were examined, and none of them were involved with tumor (pNO).

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM)**: The report states that there is no distant metastasis (pMX).

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system for oral cavity cancer, a tumor with a pT4a classification and pNO lymph nodes would correspond to **Stage IVA**.

However, since the options provided do not include Stage IVA, we need to consider the closest match. Among the options, **Stage III** is not a possible match since it would require pN1 or pN2 lymph nodes, which is not the case here. **Stage IV** is also not a match since it would require distant metastasis, which is not present.

Therefore, the closest match would be **Stage II**, which would correspond to a pT4a tumor with pNO lymph nodes. However, this is not entirely accurate since Stage II typically corresponds to a smaller tumor size.

In conclusion, the correct answer is not among the options provided. If the options were more comprehensive, the correct answer would be **Stage IVA**."

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

**Primary Tumor (pT):**
The tumor size is 2.7 x 2.6 x 0.7 cm, which is more than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension. Therefore, pT2.

**Regional Lymph Nodes (pN):**
There are 2 positive lymph nodes out of 18 in Level II, and no positive lymph nodes in Levels III and IV. Therefore, pN2b.

**Distant Metastasis (pM):**
There is no mention of distant metastasis, so pM0.

**AJCC Stage:**
Based on the pT2, pN2b, and pM0, the AJCC stage is Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
34,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can gather the following information:

* Tumor size: 2.6 x 2.2 x 2.1 cm, which is larger than 2 cm but not larger than 4 cm (T2).
* The tumor invades the mandible (bone invasion) and infiltrates skeletal muscle.
* The tumor extends to the right lingual surgical resection margin, but the new right lingual margin is free of tumor.
* There is no mention of lymph node involvement or metastasis.

Based on the AJCC staging system, a T2 tumor with bone invasion and no lymph node involvement or metastasis corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
35,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

From the report, we know that the patient has a squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, specifically in the supraglottic region. The tumor size is 4.5 cm, and it has invaded the thyroid cartilage.

The report also mentions that there is perineural invasion and angiolymphatic invasion present. Additionally, one of the 56 lymph nodes examined is positive for metastatic disease, which is located in the right level 3 lymph node.

The surgical margins of resection are free of tumor, which is a good prognostic factor.

Using the AJCC staging system, we can determine the stage as follows:

* T stage: The tumor is classified as T4a because it has invaded the thyroid cartilage.
* N stage: The presence of a single positive lymph node in the right level 3 lymph node corresponds to an N2a stage.
* M stage: There is no evidence of distant metastases, so the M stage is MX.

Therefore, the overall stage of the cancer is Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IV}"
36,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The tumor size is 3.5 cm in greatest dimension, which corresponds to T2 (tumor > 2 cm but ≤ 4 cm).
* There is metastatic carcinoma to one of 26 lymph nodes (1/11 level II lymph nodes and 0/15 level III lymph nodes), which corresponds to N1 (metastasis to a single ipsilateral lymph node, ≤ 3 cm).
* There is no evidence of distant metastasis (M0).

According to the AJCC staging manual, 6th edition, 2002, the minimal pTNM classification is pT2, pN1, pMx, which corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
37,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor's primary site, size, and extent, as well as the presence of lymph node metastases and distant metastases.

From the pathology report, we can gather the following information:

* The primary tumor is an invasive, moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma located in the tongue, with a size of 2.0 x 1.5 cm on the surface and 1.2 cm in depth.
* The tumor has focal perineural invasion, but all margins are free of tumor.
* There is metastatic squamous cell carcinoma present in 1 of 2 lymph nodes in the left modified neck dissection.
* There is no evidence of distant metastases in the thyroid, skin, or other tissues.

Based on the AJCC staging system, the primary tumor (T) is classified as T2, as it is larger than 2 cm but not larger than 4 cm. The presence of lymph node metastases (N) is classified as N1, as there is metastasis in a single ipsilateral lymph node. There is no evidence of distant metastases (M), so M0.

Therefore, the overall stage is Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
38,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the primary tumor (pT), regional lymph nodes (pN), and distant metastasis (pM).

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The primary tumor (pT) is classified as pT3, as it measures more than 4 cm in greatest dimension.
* The regional lymph nodes (pN) are classified as pN2b, as there are metastases in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes, none more than 6 cm in greatest dimension.
* There is no distant metastasis (pM).

According to the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 7th edition, 2010, the stage is determined by the combination of pT, pN, and pM. In this case, the stage is:

* pT3 (primary tumor)
* pN2b (regional lymph nodes)
* pM0 (no distant metastasis)

Therefore, the AJCC stage of the cancer is Stage III.

{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
39,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the primary tumor (pT), regional lymph nodes (pN), and distant metastasis (pM).

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The primary tumor (pT) is classified as pT4a, which indicates that the tumor has invaded the bone (mandible).
* The regional lymph nodes (pN) are classified as pNO, which means that none of the 44 regional lymph nodes examined were involved by tumor.
* The distant metastasis (pM) is classified as pMX, which means that the presence or absence of distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Based on these findings, we can determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

The primary tumor (pT4a) is classified as Stage IV, but since there is no lymph node involvement (pNO) and no distant metastasis (pMX), the overall stage is not Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is:

{""stage"" : Stage IVa}

Note: The ""a"" in Stage IVa indicates that the tumor has invaded the bone, which is a key feature of this stage."

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (T)**: The tumor size is 5 cm, which corresponds to T3 according to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual for oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N)**: Six lymph nodes were examined, and all had normal morphological structure, indicating no lymph node metastasis (N0).

3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the pathology report, so M0.

4. Now, let's determine the stage based on the TNM classification: T3N0M0.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual, a T3N0M0 corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
41,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions ""INVASIVE POORLY DIFFERENTIATED SQUAMOUS CARCINOMA"" in the mandible, which indicates a primary tumor (T) with a high degree of malignancy.
2. The tumor size is not explicitly stated, but we can infer that it is larger than 4 cm based on the description of the lesion in the mandible (8.0 cm X 2.0 cm).
3. The report mentions ""PERINEURAL INVASION"" and ""QUESTIONABLE LYMPHATICS,"" which suggests that the tumor may have invaded nearby nerves and possibly lymphatic vessels.
4. There is no evidence of distant metastases (M0) in the report.
5. The report mentions multiple re-excision biopsies with varying degrees of dysplasia and carcinoma in situ, indicating that the tumor has invaded the surrounding tissues.

Based on these findings, we can assign the following TNM classifications:

* T: T4 (invasive tumor with perineural invasion and possible lymphatic invasion)
* N: N0 (no evidence of lymph node involvement)
* M: M0 (no evidence of distant metastases)

According to the AJCC staging system, a T4N0M0 classification corresponds to Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IV}"
42,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the right tongue, and it measures 5.0 cm in greatest dimension (pT4a).
2. The tumor has invaded the deep tongue muscles but not the mandible.
3. All margins are negative, with the closest margin (posterior) being 0.6 cm.
4. There is no lymph node involvement (pNo).

According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a size greater than 4 cm (pT4a) and no lymph node involvement (pNo) corresponds to Stage IVA.

Therefore, the answer is -
{""stage"" : Stage IVA}"
43,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is an invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the left oral cavity, with a size of 3.4 cm in largest dimension and a depth of invasion of 1.4 cm. This corresponds to a T2 tumor (T1: ≤2 cm, T2: >2 cm but ≤4 cm, T3: >4 cm, T4: invades adjacent structures).
2. The report mentions that the tumor has an infiltrative border with thick cords > 4 cells, and perineural invasion is present, but vascular invasion is absent. These features do not affect the T stage.
3. The lymph nodes from levels I, II, III, and IV are all negative for tumor (0/6, 0/10, 0/18, and 0/9, respectively). This corresponds to an N0 nodal status (N0: no regional lymph node metastasis, N1: metastasis in a single ipsilateral lymph node ≤3 cm, N2: metastasis in a single ipsilateral lymph node >3 cm but ≤6 cm, N3: metastasis in a lymph node >6 cm).
4. There is no evidence of distant metastasis (M0) in the report.

Based on the above information, the AJCC stage of the cancer is:

Therefore, the answer is - {""stage"" : Stage II}"
