0,"Here are the reasoning steps:

1. The pathology report indicates a diagnosis of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, which is a relatively more favorable histological grade compared to poorly differentiated or undifferentiated tumors.
2. The tumor has infiltrated into the surrounding adipose tissue, indicating local invasion, but the tumor-free margins suggest complete resection, which is a positive factor.
3. However, the presence of four regional lymph node metastases is a significant negative factor, indicating lymphatic involvement and a higher risk of recurrence and distant metastasis.
4. The tumor is classified as pT3, indicating a more advanced stage, which is also a negative factor.
5. Despite the presence of lymph node metastases, the tumor grade is G2, which is relatively more favorable compared to G3 or G4.

Considering these factors, I would conclude that the patient's survival rate is lower due to the presence of lymph node metastases and the advanced stage of the tumor. Therefore, the answer is:

{""Survival"": ""False""}"
1,"Here are the reasoning steps:

1. The pathology report indicates a poorly differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma of the colon, which is a high-grade tumor.
2. The tumor has infiltrated through all wall layers with vascular involvement (pT3, L1, V1), indicating advanced disease.
3. The resection margins show evidence of local fatty connective tissue at the ligature region, which suggests that the tumor has infiltrated the surrounding tissue.
4. The tumor is classified as G3, which is a high-grade tumor.
5. The report indicates that the margins are R0, which means that the tumor has been completely resected.

Based on these findings, it is likely that the patient will not survive after 2.2 years. The high-grade tumor, advanced disease, and incomplete resection margins suggest a poor prognosis.
