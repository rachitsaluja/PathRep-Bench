Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (pT)**: The report mentions two primary tumors, one in the lingula (1 cm) and another in the left lower lobe (3.5 cm). The larger tumor (3.5 cm) is classified as pT2a, as it is greater than 3 cm but less than or equal to 5 cm in greatest dimension.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN)**: The report states that four lymph nodes were negative for carcinoma (0/4), indicating that there is no regional lymph node metastasis. Therefore, pN is classified as pN0.

3. **Distant Metastases (pM)**: There is no mention of distant metastases in the report, so pM is classified as pM0.

4. **TNM Descriptors**: The report mentions ""m"" (multiple primary tumors) as a TNM descriptor, indicating that there are two primary tumors.

Considering the above information, the AJCC stage of the cancer is **Stage II (T2aN0M0)**, as the primary tumor is greater than 3 cm but less than or equal to 5 cm, and there is no regional lymph node metastasis or distant metastasis.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage II}"
1,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor location is in the subpleural right lower lung lobe, and the tumor size is 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.6 cm, which corresponds to a T2 tumor (tumor size > 2 cm but ≤ 5 cm).
2. The pleural invasion is present, but lymphovascular space invasion is not identified.
3. The surgical margin status shows that the tumor is 2.8 cm away from the bronchial margin and less than 0.5 cm away from the pleural surface, focally involving the pleura microscopically.
4. The lymph node status is N0, as all lymph nodes (stations 4, 7, 11, and 12) are negative for tumor.

Based on the above information, the TNM staging is T2N0. According to the AJCC staging system, a T2N0 tumor corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
2,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Primary tumor (pT): The report states that the tumor size is 2.8 cm (greatest dimension), and it is classified as pT1b, which corresponds to a tumor larger than 2 cm but not more than 3 cm in greatest dimension.

2. Regional lymph nodes (pN): The report indicates that 1 out of 17 lymph nodes are involved (pN1). Specifically, 1 lymph node in the peribronchial region of the left lower lobe is positive for malignancy.

3. Distant metastasis (pM): The report states that the distant metastasis status is pMX, which means it cannot be assessed.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* The primary tumor is classified as pT1b, which corresponds to a T1 tumor.
* The regional lymph nodes are classified as pN1, which corresponds to an N1 tumor.
* There is no evidence of distant metastasis.

According to the AJCC staging system, a T1 tumor with N1 nodes corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
3,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The tumor size is 2.5 x 2.0 cm, which corresponds to pT1 (tumor size ≤ 3 cm).
* Ten out of twelve lymph nodes are involved by metastatic carcinoma, including the subcarinal lymph node, which indicates pN2 (metastasis in 4-6 lymph nodes).
* There is no distant metastasis (pMX).

According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor with pT1 and pN2 corresponds to Stage IIIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IIIA}"

	* Tumor site: Left upper lobe
	* Tumor focality: Unifocal
	* Tumor size: 4.5 cm
	* Visceral pleural invasion: Present
	* Lymphovascular space invasion: Present
	* Tumor extension: Tumor confined to the lung
2. The lymph node status is:
	* Total number of lymph nodes received: Six (6)

2. The visceral pleural invasion is not identified, and the tumor extension is not identified, which means there is no invasion into the visceral pleura or other structures.
3. The margins are uninvolved by invasive carcinoma, and the distance of invasive carcinoma from the closest margin is 3.4 cm.
4. Lymph nodes are negative for malignancy (0/11), which means N0.
5. There is no mention of distant metastasis, so M0.

Based on the above information, the AJCC stage is pT3, pNO, and pM0, which corresponds to Stage IIB.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IIB""}"
32,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to analyze the pathology report and identify the key components that contribute to the staging.

From the report, we can see that the primary tumor (PT) is classified as T2, which means the tumor is greater than 3 cm in greatest dimension.

The regional lymph nodes (PN) are classified as N1, which indicates metastases in ipsilateral peribronchial and ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes. The number of lymph nodes examined is two, and one is involved.

The distant metastasis (MX) is not specified, which means there is no evidence of distant metastases.

The margins are uninvolved by invasive carcinoma, and the distance of invasive carcinoma from the closest margin is 5 mm.

Additionally, the report mentions visceral pleura invasion, venous (large vessel) invasion, arterial (large vessel) invasion, and lymphatic (small vessel) invasion.

Based on these findings, we can conclude that the patient has a T2N1M0 tumor, which corresponds to Stage III according to the AJCC staging system.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
33,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Primary tumor (pT): The primary tumor measures 2.5 cm in greatest dimensions, and there is a suggestion of visceral pleural invasion. This corresponds to a pT2a tumor.

2. Regional lymph nodes (pN): The level 12 lymph nodes demonstrate evidence of metastasis, which means that the cancer has spread to the regional lymph nodes. This corresponds to a pN2 tumor.

3. Distant metastasis (pM): There is no evidence of distant metastasis in this specimen, so pM is unknown (pMX).

Based on the AJCC staging system, a pT2a tumor with pN2 lymph nodes corresponds to Stage IIIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IIIA""}"
34,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Primary tumor (pT): The tumor measures 3.5 cm in maximum dimension and invades into the pleura, which corresponds to pT2.

2. Regional lymph nodes (pN): The report states pNX, which means the lymph nodes were not assessed.

3. Distant metastasis (pM): The report states pMX, which means distant metastasis was not assessed.

Based on the information provided, we can determine the T stage as T2 (tumor size > 3 cm and invades the pleura). Since the lymph nodes and distant metastasis were not assessed, we cannot determine the N and M stages.

However, since the tumor invades the pleura, it is likely that the cancer has spread to the pleura, which would correspond to a minimum of Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
35,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the Cancer.

1. The report mentions ""Pathologic stage is T2N0MX"". This indicates that the tumor is classified as T2 (tumor size is between 2-5 cm), N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis), and MX (distant metastasis cannot be assessed).

2. The tumor size is 2.8 cm, which falls within the T2 category.

3. There is no regional lymph node metastasis (N0), as all sampled lymph nodes are benign.

4. There is no mention of distant metastasis, so MX is appropriate.

5. The report also mentions angiolymphatic and visceral pleural invasion, which is a feature of the primary tumor and does not affect the N or M classification.

6. Based on the TNM classification, a T2N0MX corresponds to Stage IIA according to the AJCC 8th edition staging system.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IIA}"
36,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor site is in the middle lobe of the right lung, and the maximum tumor size is 5.5 x 5.0 cm, which is a significant size.

2. The histologic type is non-small cell carcinoma, and the grade is G3, poorly differentiated.

3. Visceral pleural invasion is negative, but tumor extension into the fissure is present.

4. The bronchial margin is negative for tumor, and vascular parenchymal parietal pleural margins are all negative for carcinoma.

5. Lymph vascular invasion is indeterminate but favors present.

6. Twelve lymph nodes, including parts A through E, are negative for carcinoma.

7. The pathologic stage is reported as nT2N0M0, which indicates a tumor size greater than 3 cm but not more than 5 cm, no nodal involvement, and no distant metastasis.

Considering the tumor size, extension into the fissure, and lymph vascular invasion, the tumor is likely to be at least Stage II. However, since there is no nodal involvement (N0), it cannot be Stage III. Therefore, the correct stage is Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
37,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the right lung, and its size is 7 cm (mentioned in the final diagnosis of the right lung, pneumonectomy).
2. The tumor has not invaded the visceral pleura (mentioned in the final diagnosis of the right lung, pneumonectomy).
3. The bronchial and vascular margins are negative (mentioned in the final diagnosis of the right lung, pneumonectomy).
4. There is no tumor seen in the lymph nodes of levels 4, 7, and 9 (mentioned in the final diagnosis of the corresponding lymph nodes).
5. However, the tumor has metastasized to the rib (portion of the 6th rib), which is considered a distant metastasis (M1).

Based on the above information, the tumor is classified as T2 (size > 5 cm), N0 (no lymph node involvement), and M1 (distant metastasis to the rib).

According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor with M1 is automatically classified as Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IV}"
38,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Primary tumor (pT): The report states that the tumor size is 3.5 cm, which corresponds to pT2a (tumor more than 3 cm but 5 cm or less).

2. Regional lymph nodes (pN): The report mentions that there are metastases in 3 of 18 lymph nodes, which corresponds to pN1 (metastasis in ipsilateral peribronchial lymph nodes).

3. Distant metastasis (pM): There is no mention of distant metastases in the report.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* pT2a (primary tumor) + pN1 (regional lymph nodes) = Stage IIB (according to the 7th edition AJCC staging system).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IIB""}"
