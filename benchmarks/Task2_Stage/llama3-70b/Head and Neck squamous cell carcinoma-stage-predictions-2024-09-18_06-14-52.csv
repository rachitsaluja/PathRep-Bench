To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the primary tumor (T), lymph node involvement (N), and distant metastasis (M).

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The primary tumor (T) is classified as pT4a, which means the tumor has invaded the hyoid bone and/or thyroid cartilage, and/or has invaded the laryngeal cartilage and/or has extrinsic muscle invasion.
* Lymph node involvement (N) is classified as pN2c, which means there are multiple lymph nodes involved on both sides of the neck, with at least one node larger than 3 cm in greatest dimension.
* There is no evidence of distant metastasis (M), so M is classified as pMx (unknown).

Based on the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a pT4a primary tumor, pN2c lymph node involvement, and pMx distant metastasis would correspond to Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is:

{""stage"" : Stage IV}"
1,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions ""INVASIVE POORLY DIFFERENTIATED SQUAMOUS CARCINOMA WITH LYMPHATIC AND PERINEURAL INVASION FLOOR OF MOUTH."" This indicates that the tumor has invaded the floor of the mouth and has lymphatic and perineural invasion, which suggests a high degree of aggressiveness.

2. The report also states that ""TUMOR CLOSE TO MARGIN OF RESECTION,"" which implies that the tumor is close to the surgical margin, but the bone margins of resection are free of tumor.

3. The lymph node examination reveals ""Five lymph nodes, no tumor,"" which suggests that there is no lymph node involvement.

4. The tumor size is not explicitly mentioned in the report, but based on the description of the specimen, it appears to be larger than 4 cm (the size of the salivary gland).

Considering these factors, we can determine the T stage as T4a (tumor invades the floor of the mouth and has lymphatic and perineural invasion) and the N stage as N0 (no lymph node involvement).

According to the AJCC staging system, a T4a tumor with no lymph node involvement corresponds to Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IV}"
2,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (pT)**: The tumor size is 4 cm, which falls into the category of ""Tumor more than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension"" (pT2).
2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN)**: There are metastases in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes (pN2b), with 3 out of 51 nodes involved, and focal extranodal extension is present.
3. **Distant Metastasis (pM)**: The report states ""pMX: cannot be assessed"", which means there is no evidence of distant metastasis.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* The primary tumor is pT2 (4 cm in size).
* The regional lymph nodes are pN2b (multiple ipsilateral nodes involved with extranodal extension).
* There is no evidence of distant metastasis (pMX).

According to the AJCC staging system, a pT2 primary tumor with pN2b regional lymph nodes and no distant metastasis corresponds to **Stage IV**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IV}"
3,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC Stage of the cancer.

First, we need to identify the primary tumor (T) stage. The report states that the tumor is 1.9 cm in size, and there is no angiolymphatic invasion or perineural invasion. The surgical margins are 1.6 mm to the deep margin and 3 mm to the medial margin, with the remaining margins >1 cm. Based on this information, the primary tumor (T) stage is T1.

Next, we need to determine the nodal (N) stage. The report states that 24 lymph nodes are negative for carcinoma (0/24), and there is no evidence of metastatic carcinoma in the lymph nodes. Therefore, the nodal (N) stage is N0.

Finally, we need to determine the metastasis (M) stage. There is no evidence of distant metastasis in the report, so the metastasis (M) stage is M0.

Based on the T, N, and M stages, we can determine the overall AJCC Stage of the cancer. According to the AJCC staging system, a T1N0M0 corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
4,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (pT)**: The report states that the tumor is 3.5 cm in greatest dimension, which corresponds to pT2 (Tumor more than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension).
2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN)**: The report indicates that there is no regional lymph node metastasis (pN0), as 27 lymph nodes were examined and none were involved.
3. **Distant Metastasis (pM)**: There is no mention of distant metastasis, so pM0.

Based on the AJCC staging system, the stage is determined by the combination of pT, pN, and pM. In this case, we have:

* pT2 (tumor size 3.5 cm)
* pN0 (no lymph node metastasis)
* pM0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC staging system, this corresponds to **Stage II**.

Therefore, the answer is:
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
5,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions ""pT2"", which indicates the primary tumor is of size 2.6 x 2.6 x 1.0 cm, invading the subglottal and supraglottal regions. According to the AJCC staging system, a T2 tumor is larger than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension, and may involve the supraglottis and/or glottis and/or subglottis.

2. The report also mentions ""pNO"", which indicates there is no evidence of regional lymph node metastasis.

3. There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report.

Based on the above information, the tumor is classified as T2N0M0, which corresponds to Stage II according to the AJCC staging system.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
6,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary tumor (T)**: The tumor size is 5.0 x 3.0 cm, and it invades the anterior space, thyroid cartilage, and epiglottic cartilage with extensive perineural invasion. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual, this corresponds to T4a (tumor invades thyroid cartilage, trachea, cricoid cartilage, or mediastinal structures).

2. **Lymph nodes (N)**: There are 5/42 positive lymph nodes, with macrometastasis (size of large metastatic focus 2.2 cm) and no extracapsular extension present. This corresponds to N2b (metastasis in multiple lymph nodes, none larger than 6 cm).

3. **Distant metastasis (M)**: There is no evidence of distant metastasis in the report.

Based on the above, the AJCC stage is determined by combining the T, N, and M categories. In this case, the stage is T4a, N2b, M0, which corresponds to **Stage IV**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IV}"
7,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the Cancer:

1. **Tumor size and extent**: The tumor size is 4 x 2 cm, which is a significant size, but not explicitly stated as T1, T2, T3, or T4. However, the tumor extent is mentioned as ""Deep muscles of the tongue"", which suggests a more advanced local invasion, likely corresponding to T3.

2. **Lymph node involvement**: The report states that 1/4 of the lymph nodes are positive for metastasis, specifically in the cervical region. This indicates N1 disease (metastasis in a single lymph node, 3 cm or less in greatest dimension).

3. **Margins and distant metastasis**: The margins are uninvolved, and there is no mention of distant metastasis.

Considering the above factors, we can determine the AJCC Stage as follows:

* Tumor size and extent: T3 (deep muscles of the tongue)
* Lymph node involvement: N1 (metastasis in a single lymph node, 3 cm or less in greatest dimension)
* Distant metastasis: M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T3N1M0 corresponds to **Stage III**.

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is a squamous cell carcinoma of the left tonsil fossa, with a greatest dimension of 5.0 cm (pT4a).
2. The tumor is moderately to poorly differentiated and infiltrates salivary glands and skeletal muscle (including tongue).
3. The tumor is extensively present at the cauterized superior aspect of the lateral surgical margin, focally at the cauterized posterior margin, closely approaching the inferolateral margin, less than 0.1 cm to the medial uvula margin, and 0.4 cm from the medial tongue margin.
4. There are metastases in four of 35 lymph nodes: 1/8 level IIA, 2/8 level III, 1/5 level IV, and 0/2 left facial, 0/1 level V.
5. The largest positive node is 2.5 cm (level III) measured grossly, and the other positive nodes are approximately 1.5 cm, 1.2 cm, and 1.1 cm based on microscopy.
6. Both level III nodes and the level IIA node have extracapsular extension.

Based on the above information, the AJCC stage is determined as follows:

* pT4a: The primary tumor is classified as T4a due to its size (> 4 cm) and infiltration of surrounding tissues (salivary glands and skeletal muscle).
* N2b: The tumor has metastasized to multiple lymph nodes (four of 35), with extracapsular extension in at least one node (level III).
* MX: The presence of distant metastases is unknown (MX).

12,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (T)**: The tumor size is 1 x 0 x 1.5 cm, which is relatively small. The tumor is localized to the larynx, and there is no mention of extension to surrounding structures. Therefore, the T stage is likely T1 or T2.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N)**: There is no mention of lymph nodes in the pathology report, which suggests that they were not examined or were negative for cancer. Therefore, the N stage is likely N0.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the pathology report.

Based on the above analysis, the AJCC stage is likely Stage I or Stage II, as the tumor is localized to the larynx, and there is no evidence of lymph node involvement or distant metastasis.

However, since the tumor is ulcerated and involves all parts of the larynx, it is more likely to be Stage II, as it has a higher T stage (T2) due to the involvement of more than one subsite of the larynx.

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

**Primary Tumor (T):**
The tumor is located in the supraglottis with extension into the glottis, and its greatest dimension is 3.6 cm. This corresponds to a T2 tumor, as it invades the mucosa of a region outside the supraglottis.

**Regional Lymph Nodes (N):**
There are metastases in bilateral lymph nodes, with none larger than 6 cm in greatest dimension. This corresponds to an N2c classification, as there are metastases in bilateral lymph nodes, but none are larger than 6 cm.

**Distant Metastasis (M):**
There is no evidence of distant metastasis in the report.

**AJCC Stage:**
Based on the T2, N2c, and M0 classifications, the AJCC stage of the cancer is Stage III.

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (pT)**: The report states that the primary tumor is pT4a, which means the tumor has invaded the skin of the cheek and is larger than 4 cm in greatest dimension.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN)**: The report states that 45 regional lymph nodes were examined, and none of them were involved with tumor (pNO).

3. **Distant Metastasis (pM)**: The report states that there is no distant metastasis (pMX).

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system for oral cavity cancer, a tumor with a pT4a classification and pNO lymph nodes would correspond to **Stage IVA**.

However, since the options provided do not include Stage IVA, we need to consider the closest match. Among the options, **Stage III** is not a possible match since it would require pN1 or pN2 lymph nodes, which is not the case here. **Stage IV** is also not a match since it would require distant metastasis, which is not present.

Therefore, the closest match would be **Stage II**, which would correspond to a pT4a tumor with pNO lymph nodes. However, please note that this is not an exact match according to the AJCC staging system.

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, I will carefully review the pathology report and extract the relevant information.

First, I note that the patient has invasive squamous cell carcinoma in both the right and left aryepiglottic folds, which suggests that the tumor is bilateral.

The report also mentions that the tumor is extending into adjacent cartilage in the left aryepiglottic fold, which indicates that the tumor has invaded the cartilage.

According to the AJCC staging system, the primary tumor (T) is classified as T3 if the tumor invades the cartilage or bone. Since the tumor has invaded the cartilage, I would classify the primary tumor as T3.

There is no mention of lymph node involvement or distant metastases in the report, so I would assume that the lymph node status (N) is N0 and the metastasis status (M) is M0.

Based on the T3N0M0 classification, I would determine the AJCC stage of the cancer as Stage III.

33,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

**Primary Tumor (pT):**
The tumor size is 2.7 x 2.6 x 0.7 cm, which is more than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension. Therefore, pT2.

**Regional Lymph Nodes (pN):**
There are 2 positive lymph nodes out of 18 in Level II, and no positive lymph nodes in Levels III and IV. Therefore, pN2b.

**Distant Metastasis (pM):**
There is no mention of distant metastasis, so pM0.

**AJCC Stage:**
Based on the pT2, pN2b, and pM0, the AJCC stage is Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - {""stage"" : Stage III}"

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions ""SQUAMOUS CARCINOMA, MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED"" which indicates the type and grade of the tumor.
2. The tumor size is reported as 2.6 x 2.2 x 2.1 cm, which is a key factor in determining the T stage.
3. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a tumor size of 2.6 cm falls into the T2 category (T2: Tumor > 2 cm but â‰¤ 4 cm).
4. The report also mentions ""PERINEURAL INVOLVEMENT"" which is a high-risk feature, but it does not affect the T stage.
5. The tumor extends to the right lingual surgical resection margin, but the new right lingual margin is free of tumor, indicating that the margins are clear.
6. There is no mention of lymph node involvement or distant metastasis in the report.

Based on the above information, the T stage is T2, and there is no evidence of lymph node involvement or distant metastasis. Therefore, the stage is determined by the T stage alone.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2 tumor corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
35,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

From the report, we know that the patient has a squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, specifically in the supraglottic region. The tumor size is 4.5 cm, and it has invaded the thyroid cartilage.

The report also mentions that there is perineural invasion and angiolymphatic invasion present. Additionally, one of the 56 lymph nodes examined is positive for metastatic disease, which is located in the right level 3 lymph node.

The surgical margins of resection are free of tumor, which is a good prognostic factor.

Using the AJCC staging system, we can determine the stage as follows:

* T stage: The tumor is classified as T4a because it has invaded the thyroid cartilage.
* N stage: The presence of a single positive lymph node in the right level 3 lymph node classifies the N stage as N2a.
* M stage: There is no evidence of distant metastases, so the M stage is MX.

Therefore, the overall stage of the cancer is Stage IV.

However, since the M stage is MX, which means distant metastases cannot be assessed, we cannot classify the cancer as Stage IV. Instead, we should consider the highest T and N stages, which are T4a and N2a, respectively.

According to the AJCC staging system, a T4a tumor with N2a lymph nodes corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is:

{""stage"" : Stage III}"
36,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The tumor size is 3.5 cm in greatest dimension, which corresponds to T2 (tumor > 2 cm but â‰¤ 4 cm).
* There is metastatic carcinoma to one of 26 lymph nodes (1/11 level II lymph nodes and 0/15 level III lymph nodes), which corresponds to N1 (metastasis to a single ipsilateral lymph node, â‰¤ 3 cm).
* There is no evidence of distant metastasis (M0).

According to the AJCC staging manual, 6th edition, 2002, the minimal pTNM classification is pT2, pN1, pMx, which corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is an invasive, moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, with a size of 2.0 X 1.5 cm on the surface and 1.2 cm in depth.
2. The tumor has focal perineural invasion, but all margins are free of tumor.
3. There is metastatic squamous cell carcinoma present in 1 of 2 lymph nodes in the left modified neck dissection.
4. There is no tumor present in the thyroid, skin, or bone.

Based on the AJCC staging system, the primary tumor (T) is classified as T2 (tumor > 2 cm but â‰¤ 4 cm in greatest dimension). The presence of metastatic disease in the lymph nodes (N) is classified as N1 (metastasis in a single ipsilateral lymph node, â‰¤ 3 cm in greatest dimension). There is no distant metastasis (M0).

Therefore, the overall stage is Stage III (T2N1M0).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
38,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the primary tumor (pT), regional lymph nodes (pN), and distant metastasis (pM).

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The primary tumor (pT) is classified as pT3, as it measures more than 4 cm in greatest dimension.
* The regional lymph nodes (pN) are classified as pN2b, as there are metastases in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes, none more than 6 cm in greatest dimension.
* There is no distant metastasis (pM).

According to the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 7th edition, 2010, the stage is determined by the combination of pT, pN, and pM. In this case, the stage is:

* pT3 (primary tumor)
* pN2b (regional lymph nodes)
* pM0 (no distant metastasis)

Therefore, the AJCC stage of the cancer is Stage III.

39,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the primary tumor (pT), regional lymph nodes (pN), and distant metastasis (pM).

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The primary tumor (pT) is classified as pT4a, which indicates that the tumor has invaded the bone (mandible).
* The regional lymph nodes (pN) are classified as pNO, which means that none of the 44 regional lymph nodes examined were involved by tumor.
* The distant metastasis (pM) is classified as pMX, which means that the presence or absence of distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Based on the AJCC staging system, a pT4a primary tumor with no regional lymph node involvement (pNO) and unknown distant metastasis (pMX) corresponds to Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IV}"

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (T)**: The tumor size is 5 cm, which corresponds to T3 according to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual for oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N)**: Six lymph nodes were examined, and all had normal morphological structure, indicating no lymph node metastasis (N0).

3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the pathology report, so M0.

4. Now, let's determine the stage based on the TNM classification: T3N0M0.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual, a T3N0M0 corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions ""INVASIVE POORLY DIFFERENTIATED SQUAMOUS CARCINOMA"" in the mandible, which indicates a primary tumor (T) with a high degree of malignancy.
2. The tumor size is not explicitly stated, but we can infer that it is larger than 4 cm based on the description of the lesion (1.5 cm ulcerated, raised, and roughened) and the fact that it extends to the anterior gingival surface of the posterior sixth and fifth tooth.
3. The report mentions ""PERINEURAL INVASION"" and ""QUESTIONABLE LYMPHATICS,"" which suggests that the tumor may have invaded nearby nerves and possibly lymphatic vessels.
4. There is no evidence of distant metastases (M) mentioned in the report.
5. The report does not provide information about the number of lymph nodes involved (N), but it does mention that the margins of resection are free of tumor.

Based on the above information, we can assign the following AJCC stage components:

* T: T4 (primary tumor is larger than 4 cm and invades nearby structures, such as bone)
* N: Nx (lymph node status is unknown)
* M: M0 (no distant metastases)

According to the AJCC staging system, a T4 tumor with unknown lymph node status and no distant metastases corresponds to Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IV}"
