To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to analyze the pathology report and identify the key factors that influence staging.

From the report, we can see that the patient has two separate primary tumors: one in the lingula (1 cm) and another in the left lower lobe (3.5 cm). Both tumors are adenocarcinomas with different histological subtypes.

The tumor in the lingula is classified as pT1a, as it measures 1 cm in greatest dimension and is surrounded by lung or visceral pleura without bronchoscopic evidence of invasion more proximal than the lobar bronchus.

The tumor in the left lower lobe is classified as pT2a, as it measures 3.5 cm in greatest dimension and is surrounded by lung or visceral pleura without bronchoscopic evidence of invasion more proximal than the lobar bronchus.

There is no evidence of lymph node metastasis (pN0), and no distant metastases are reported (pM0).

Given the presence of two separate primary tumors, the TNM descriptors include ""m"" to indicate multiple primary tumors.

Based on the above information, the patient's AJCC stage is Stage II (T2a, N0, M0).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage II}"
1,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor characteristics are:
	* Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated
	* Tumor location: Subpleural right lower lung lobe
	* Tumor size: 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.6 cm
	* Tumor grade: Moderately differentiated
2. The tumor invasiveness is:
	* Pleural invasion: Yes (tumor appears to focally involve overlying pleura)
	* Lymphovascular space invasion: No
3. The surgical margin status is:
	* Tumor distance from bronchial margin: 2.8 cm
	* Tumor distance from stapled margin: Not applicable
	* Tumor distance from pleural surface: Less than 0.5 cm, focally involving pleura microscopically
4. The lymph node status is:
	* All lymph nodes (R, L, Station 11, Station 12, and Station 7) are negative for tumor

Based on the above information, we can determine the T, N, and M stages:

* T stage: T2 (tumor size is 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.6 cm, and there is pleural invasion)
* N stage: N0 (all lymph nodes are negative for tumor)
* M stage: M0 (not mentioned in the report, but assumed to be M0 since there is no evidence of distant metastasis)

Therefore, the AJCC stage is T2N0M0, which corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
2,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Primary tumor (pT): The report states pT1b, which means the tumor is 2.8 cm in greatest dimension, and it has not invaded the visceral pleura or extended beyond the lung.

2. Regional lymph nodes (pN): The report states pN1, which means there is metastasis to one or more ipsilateral peribronchial or hilar lymph nodes.

3. Distant metastasis (pM): The report states pMX, which means distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Based on the pT1b and pN1, the patient has a tumor that is 2.8 cm in size and has metastasized to one or more ipsilateral peribronchial or hilar lymph nodes. This corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
3,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The maximum tumor size is 2.5 x 2.0 cm, which corresponds to a T1 tumor (pT1).
* Ten out of twelve lymph nodes are involved by metastatic carcinoma, including the subcarinal lymph node. This indicates N2 disease (pN2).
* There is no distant metastasis (pMX).
* The margins are all negative, but the tumor approaches to within less than 1 mm of the inked hilar pleural surface.
* There is extensive lymphvascular invasion in the lung, including subpleural lymphatics.

Based on these findings, the tumor is classified as T1N2M0, which corresponds to Stage IIIA according to the AJCC 8th edition staging system.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IIIA}"
4,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Primary tumor (pT): The report states that the tumor measures 2.7 cm in greatest dimension and invades the visceral pleura, which corresponds to a pT2a.
2. Regional lymph nodes (pN): The report states that two lymph nodes were examined, and none were involved, which corresponds to a pN0.
3. Distant metastasis (pM): The report does not mention any distant metastasis, which corresponds to a pM0.

According to the AJCC 7th edition staging system, a pT2a, pN0, and pM0 correspond to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
5,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Primary Tumor (pT): The report states that the tumor is 2.5 cm in greatest dimension, surrounded by lung or visceral pleura, without bronchoscopic evidence of invasion more proximal than the lobar bronchus. This corresponds to pT1b.

2. Regional Lymph Nodes (pN): The report indicates that there is no regional lymph node metastasis, which corresponds to pN0.

3. Distant Metastases (pM): There is no mention of distant metastases, so pM is not applicable.

Based on the pT and pN classifications, the AJCC stage is determined as follows:

* pT1b and pN0 correspond to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
6,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions a 5 x 4 x 3 cm centrally located mass in the right lower lobe of the lung, which is the primary tumor (T).
2. The bronchial margin is negative for tumor, indicating that the tumor has not invaded the bronchial margin.
3. One of the six intrapulmonary peribronchial lymph nodes is positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma, which indicates lymph node involvement (N).
4. The report mentions multiple lymph nodes in the inferior and superior mediastinal regions, as well as the N1 region, which are involved by necrotizing granuloma but are negative for tumor.
5. There is no evidence of distant metastases (M) in the report.

Based on the TNM staging system, we can assign the following values:

* T: T2 (tumor size is 5 cm or larger)
* N: N1 (metastasis to intrapulmonary peribronchial lymph nodes)
* M: M0 (no distant metastases)

According to the AJCC staging system, a T2N1M0 corresponds to Stage IIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
7,"## Answer

The patient's pathology report indicates that the tumor is 2.3 cm in greatest diameter, which corresponds to a T1b tumor according to the AJCC TNM staging system. The report also states that there is no residual carcinoma identified within the lobectomy specimen, and no metastatic carcinoma is identified in the lymph nodes (pN0). 

Therefore, the patient's tumor is staged as pT1b NO, which corresponds to Stage I according to the AJCC TNM staging system.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
8,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor is located in the right upper lobe, and its size is 3.5 x 2.4 x 2.3 cm.
2. The tumor does not grossly involve the bronchus, but it appears to be growing around the bronchus. The distance to the bronchial margin is 0.3 cm.
3. There are two small pleural nodules, one 0.4 cm in diameter and 5.2 cm from the main tumor mass, and another 0.4 cm in diameter and 3.1 cm from the main tumor mass.
4. The tumor is moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, and the histologic grade is moderately differentiated.
5. One of the five hilar lymph nodes is positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma.
6. The surgical margins, including the bronchial resection margin, appear negative for carcinoma.
7. There is no pleural involvement, and no in situ carcinoma is identified.
8. Perineural invasion is present, but angiolymphatic invasion is not identified.

Based on the above findings, we can determine the T, N, and M stages as follows:

* T stage: T2a (tumor size is 3.5 cm, and it does not invade the pleura)
* N stage: N1 (metastatic adenocarcinoma involving one of the five hilar lymph nodes)
* M stage: M0 (no distant metastases are identified)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2a, N1, M0 corresponds to Stage IIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IIA}"
9,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions a left lower lobectomy with a tumor measuring 50 x 60 x 45 mm, which involves the posterior lateral basal and anterior basal segments. This suggests a significant tumor size, but no specific T stage is mentioned.

2. The tumor appears to surround a major segmental bronchus and extends close to the bronchial resection margin, but the medial margin is not involved. This implies that the tumor is likely to be T2, as it has not invaded the mediastinum or other structures.

3. The report mentions that the tumor probably does not involve the pleura, and this is confirmed by special stains in the addendum report. Therefore, there is no pleural invasion (PL0).

4. The report states that there is no vascular or perineural invasion.

5. The hilar lymph node shows no evidence of metastatic malignancy, indicating N0.

6. There is no mention of distant metastases, so Mx is assigned.

Based on the above findings, the TNM stage is T2N0Mx. According to the AJCC staging system, this corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
10,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer:

1. **Tumor size**: The tumor size is 3 x 3 x 3 cm, which is a significant size but not explicitly stated to be > 5 cm or â‰¤ 3 cm, so we can't determine the T stage solely based on this information.

2. **Tumor extent**: The tumor extends to the visceral pleura, which indicates a T2a stage (involvement of visceral pleura).

3. **Lymph nodes**: There is 1/1 positive lymph node for metastasis, which is an N1 stage (metastasis in intrathoracic lymph nodes).

4. **Distant metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report.

Considering the T2a stage and N1 stage, the patient's cancer is at least Stage II (T2a, N1, M0). However, since there is no evidence of distant metastasis, it's unlikely to be Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
11,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor size is 4.0 X 3.5 X 2.0 cm, which corresponds to a T2 classification according to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual (tumors >3 cm but â‰¤5 cm in greatest dimension).

2. The report mentions ""Infiltration of pleura visceralis"", which indicates that the tumor has invaded the visceral pleura. This does not affect the T classification, as it is already T2.

3. The lymph node status is pNO (0/20), indicating that no lymph nodes are involved. This corresponds to an N0 classification.

4. The report does not mention any distant metastases, and the pMx classification indicates that the presence of distant metastases cannot be assessed. However, in the absence of any evidence of distant metastases, we can assume that the M classification is M0.

5. Combining the T, N, and M classifications, we get a stage of T2N0M0, which corresponds to Stage II according to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
12,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and metastasis.

From the pathology report, we know that:

1. The tumor size is 2.7 cm in diameter, which corresponds to T1b (tumor size > 2 cm but â‰¤ 3 cm).
2. There is no pleural involvement (PL0) and no angiolymphatic invasion (L0).
3. The bronchial margin is not involved, and the tumor is at least 0.6 cm from the staple line, indicating negative surgical margins (R0).
4. One peribronchial lymph node (1/4) is positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma, but there is no extracapsular extension.

Based on the AJCC 8th edition staging system, the T category is T1b, the N category is N1 (metastasis in ipsilateral peribronchial lymph nodes), and the M category is M0 (no distant metastasis).

Therefore, the AJCC stage is Stage II (T1bN1M0).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
13,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (T)**: The tumor size is 1.2 cm, and it focally invades into, but not through, the visceral pleura. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual, this corresponds to a T2 tumor.
2. **Lymph Nodes (N)**: The report states that 7 lymph nodes were examined, and none of them were involved with cancer (0/7). This corresponds to an N0 lymph node status.
3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: There is no mention of distant metastases in the report. Therefore, we can assume that the M status is MX, which means that the presence or absence of distant metastases cannot be assessed.

Based on the TNM staging system, we can determine the overall stage of the cancer. With a T2 primary tumor, N0 lymph node status, and MX distant metastasis status, the patient's cancer corresponds to **Stage I**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
14,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Primary tumor (T): The report mentions a 4 cm adenocarcinoma, acinar type, grade III, invading visceral pleura in the right lower lobe. This corresponds to a pT2 tumor, as it is larger than 3 cm but not more than 5 cm, and invades the visceral pleura.

2. Lymph nodes (N): The report shows metastatic adenocarcinoma in two of four lymph nodes (2/4) in the right lower lobe, and in one of five lymph nodes (1/5) in level 7 lymph node. This indicates that there is involvement of mediastinal lymph nodes, which corresponds to an N2 designation.

3. Distant metastasis (M): There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so it is classified as Mx (cannot be assessed).

Based on the above, the AJCC stage is pT2, N2, Mx, which corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
15,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to analyze the pathology report and identify the key factors that influence staging.

1. **Primary Tumor (T)**: The tumor is described as an ""invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma"" with a greatest dimension of 9.2 cm, invading into the chest wall (pT3).
2. **Lymph Node Involvement (N)**: The report states that 19 peribronchial lymph nodes are negative for carcinoma (0/19), and 6 lymph nodes from levels 1-9 are also negative (0/6). This indicates that there is no lymph node involvement (N0).
3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so we can assume that M0 (no distant metastasis).

Based on these factors, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* T3 (primary tumor size and invasion into the chest wall)
* N0 (no lymph node involvement)
* M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 7th Edition, the stage corresponding to these factors is:

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
16,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to analyze the pathology report and identify the key features that affect staging.

From the report, we can see that the patient has a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in the left lower lobe of the lung, measuring 6.9 x 4.7 x 4.1 cm. The tumor extends to the visceral pleural surface, and lymphangitic invasion is identified.

The lymph node status is also critical in determining the stage. The report shows that multiple lymph nodes are positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma, including:

* One lymph node positive in the left level 9 lymph node (C1FS)
* Two of five lymph nodes positive in the left level 11 lymph node (D)
* Four of eight peribronchial lymph nodes positive in the left lower lobe (E)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, the primary tumor (pT) is classified as pT2b, as the tumor is greater than 5 cm but less than or equal to 7 cm in greatest dimension.

The regional lymph nodes (pN) are classified as pN2, as there is metastasis in ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes.

There is no evidence of distant metastasis (pM).

Based on these findings, the AJCC stage of the cancer is Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
17,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the Cancer.

1. The report appears to be a general pathology report information form, which provides details about the tumor type, specimen, and diagnosis.
2. There is no specific information about the tumor size, lymph node involvement, or metastasis, which are crucial factors in determining the AJCC Stage.
3. The report does not provide any information about the TNM classification (T - tumor size, N - lymph node involvement, M - metastasis), which is essential for determining the AJCC Stage.
4. Without the TNM classification, it is not possible to determine the AJCC Stage accurately.

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the Cancer.

1. The diagnosis mentions a peripheral, well-differentiated papillary, non-mucigenous adenocarcinoma measuring 50 mm, which indicates the primary tumor size (T).
2. The report states that the tumor extends as far as the visceral pleura, but it is tumor-free, indicating that the tumor has not invaded the pleura (no pleural invasion).
3. The tumor classification is provided as pT2, which corresponds to a tumor larger than 3 cm but not larger than 5 cm (50 mm is approximately 2 inches, which falls within this range).
4. The report also mentions pN0, indicating that there is no regional lymph node involvement (N).
5. The pMX notation indicates that distant metastases (M) cannot be assessed.
6. The report explicitly states the stage as ""stage I B"" with a resection margin of R0, indicating that the tumor has been completely resected.

Considering the above information, the correct stage is Stage I B, which corresponds to a tumor larger than 3 cm but not larger than 5 cm, with no regional lymph node involvement and no distant metastases.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I B""}"
19,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor is located in the left upper lobe, and its size is 4.5 cm (T2a).
2. Visceral pleural invasion is present, which does not affect the T stage.
3. Lymphovascular space invasion is present, which also does not affect the T stage.
4. The tumor is confined to the lung, with no extension to other organs.
5. The surgical margin status shows that the tumor is 4.5 cm away from the bronchial margin, and the pleural surface is involved.
6. Lymph node status reveals that out of 6 lymph nodes received, 1 lymph node contains metastatic carcinoma (N1).
7. There is no mention of distant metastases (M0).

Based on the above information, the pTNM stage is pT2aN1MX.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a tumor with a T2a primary, N1 lymph node involvement, and no distant metastases (M0) corresponds to Stage IIA.

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the Cancer.

1. The tumor site is the lung, and the tumor size is 2.5 X 1.5 X 3 cm, which is a significant size but not explicitly stated to be invading nearby structures or organs.

2. The histologic type is bronchiolo-alveolar adenocarcinoma, which is a type of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The histologic grade is poorly differentiated, indicating aggressive tumor behavior.

3. However, there is no information about tumor extent, lymph node involvement, lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, or margin status, which are crucial factors in determining the AJCC Stage.

4. Without this information, we cannot determine if the tumor has invaded nearby structures, lymph nodes, or distant organs, which would indicate a higher stage.

5. Given the limited information, the most conservative approach is to assume the tumor is confined to the lung and has not invaded nearby structures or lymph nodes, which would correspond to Stage I.

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor size is 6.5 x 6.5 x 5.0 cm, which corresponds to a pT2b classification according to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual. This indicates that the tumor is larger than 5 cm but not larger than 7 cm.

2. The report states ""No Infiltration of pleura visceralis"", which means there is no invasion of the visceral pleura. This is important because invasion of the visceral pleura would upgrade the T classification to pT3.

3. The lymph node status is pN1, indicating that there are metastases in 6 out of 28 lymph nodes examined. This is a key factor in determining the overall stage.

4. The report states ""pMx"", which means that the presence of distant metastases cannot be assessed. However, since there is no mention of distant metastases, we can assume that there are no distant metastases.

5. Based on the pT2b and pN1 classifications, we can determine the overall stage. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual, a pT2b tumor with pN1 lymph nodes corresponds to Stage IIA.

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to analyze the pathology report and identify the key factors that influence staging.

1. **Primary Tumor (T)**: The tumor size is 3.5 cm, and it is located in the left upper lobe. There is no visceral pleura invasion, atelectasis, or obstructive pneumonitis. Therefore, the T stage is T2a (tumor 3-4 cm in greatest dimension).

2. **Lymph Nodes (N)**: The pathology report shows that 2 of 2 peribronchial nodes are positive for metastatic tumor, and 3 out of 12 lymph nodes examined are involved. This indicates that the N stage is N1 (metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial and/or hilar lymph nodes and intrapulmonary nodes, including involvement by direct extension).

3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: There is no evidence of distant metastasis in the pathology report. Therefore, the M stage is MX (distant metastasis cannot be assessed).

Based on the TNM staging system, the AJCC stage is determined by combining the T, N, and M stages. In this case, the stage is II (T2a, N1, MX).

Therefore, the answer is -

27,"## Answer

From the pathology report, we can identify the AJCC stage of the cancer by analyzing the tumor characteristics and lymph node involvement.

1. Tumor location: Left upper lobe
2. Tumor size: 3.5 X 2.8 X 2.5 cm (pT2a)
3. Vascular invasion: Not identified
4. Lymphatic invasion: Pending (not relevant for staging)
5. Bronchial margin: Negative, but tumor cells are present within lymphatic spaces
6. Vascular margin: Negative
7. Parenchymal margins: Not applicable
8. Pleura/soft tissue margin: The tumor invades into the visceral pleura
9. Lymph node involvement: Metastatic adenocarcinoma in peribronchial lymph nodes (pN2)

Based on the above information, the patient has a pT2a tumor (size >2 cm but â‰¤5 cm) with invasion into the visceral pleura and metastasis to peribronchial lymph nodes (pN2). According to the AJCC staging system, this corresponds to a p stage IIIA (pT2a N2 MX).

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor is a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, which is a type of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
2. The tumor measures 58 mm in maximum dimension, which corresponds to T2a (tumor > 4 cm but â‰¤ 5 cm).
3. The tumor invades the visceral pleura and chest wall fibrous connective tissue, which corresponds to T3 (tumor invades the chest wall).
4. There is no lymphatic or perineural invasion, but blood vessel invasion is present.
5. No lymph node metastases are seen in the hilar lymph nodes (1B) or peri-oesophageal lymph node (3).
6. The tumor is clear of the bronchial resection margin.
7. The supplementary report shows no residual malignancy within the chest wall tissues, and no involvement of rib bone or soft tissue resection margin.

Based on these findings, the TNM classification is:

* T3: Tumor invades the chest wall
* N0: No lymph node metastases
* M0: No distant metastases (not mentioned in the report, but assumed to be absent)

29,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the cancer.

1. The report provides information about the tumor size (T), lymph node involvement (N), and distant metastasis (M).
2. The tumor size is described as T2, which means the tumor is larger than 3 cm but not larger than 5 cm.
3. The lymph node involvement is described as N1, which means there is metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes.
4. The distant metastasis is described as M0, which means there is no distant metastasis.

Now, let's refer to the AJCC staging system for lung cancer:

* Stage I: T1-2, N0, M0 (tumor is localized to the lung, no lymph node involvement, and no distant metastasis)
* Stage II: T1-2, N1, M0 (tumor is localized to the lung, with involvement of ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes, and no distant metastasis)
* Stage III: T1-4, N2-3, M0 (tumor is localized to the lung, with involvement of mediastinal and/or contralateral lymph nodes, and no distant metastasis) or T3-4, N0-1, M0 (tumor is large or invades nearby structures, with or without involvement of ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes, and no distant metastasis)
* Stage IV: Any T, Any N, M1 (tumor has distant metastasis)

Based on the pathology report, the patient has a T2 tumor with N1 lymph node involvement and no distant metastasis (M0). This matches the description of Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is -

2. **Lymph node involvement**: The report states that 0/7 hilar lymph nodes are positive for metastasis, indicating that there is no lymph node involvement (N0).
3. **Distant metastasis**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report.
4. **Margins**: The margins are uninvolved, which is not a factor in determining the AJCC stage.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* T2a (tumor size 3.5 cm)
* N0 (no lymph node involvement)
* M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2a, N0, M0 corresponds to **Stage I**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
31,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor site is the upper lobe of the right lung, and there are two separate tumor nodules in the same lobe.
2. The tumor sizes are 3.7 cm, 2.9 x 2.8 cm, and 1.2 cm x 0.8 cm x 0.7 cm.
3. There is no visceral pleural invasion, and the tumor extension is not identified.
4. The margins are uninvolved by invasive carcinoma, with a distance of 3.4 cm from the closest margin (parenchymal margin).
5. Lymphovascular invasion is not identified.
6. The number of lymph nodes examined is 11, and none of them are involved (pNO).
7. The pathologic staging is reported as Stage IIB, with a pT3 (tumor size > 3 cm) and pNO (no lymph node involvement).

Based on the above information, the correct answer is:

Therefore, the answer is - {""stage"" : Stage IIB}"
32,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The tumor size is 3.5 cm, which corresponds to T2 (Tumor greater than 3 cm in greatest dimension).
* The regional lymph nodes are involved, with metastases in ipsilateral peribronchial and ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes (N1).
* There is no distant metastasis (MX).
* The margins are uninvolved by invasive carcinoma, and the distance of invasive tumor from the closest margin is 5 mm.
* There is direct extension of the tumor to the visceral pleura, and venous, arterial, and lymphatic invasion are present.

Based on these findings, the AJCC stage is:

* T2: Tumor greater than 3 cm in greatest dimension
* N1: Metastases in ipsilateral peribronchial and ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes
* MX: No distant metastasis

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
33,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the primary tumor (pT), regional lymph nodes (pN), and distant metastasis (pM).

From the pathology report, we know that:

* The primary tumor (pT) measures 2.5 cm in greatest dimension, and there is a suggestion of visceral pleural invasion. This corresponds to a pT2a.
* The regional lymph nodes (pN) show evidence of metastasis in the level 12 lymph nodes (4/4 nodes). This corresponds to a pN2.
* There is no evidence of distant metastasis (pM) in this specimen, so it is pMX.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a pT2a primary tumor with pN2 regional lymph nodes corresponds to Stage IIIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage IIIA""}"
34,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Primary tumor (pT): The tumor measures 3.5 cm in maximum dimension and invades into the pleura, which corresponds to pT2.
2. Margins of resection: Negative, which means the tumor does not extend to the resection margins.
3. Vascular invasion: Present, which is a poor prognostic factor.
4. Regional lymph nodes (pN): pNX, which means the lymph node status is unknown.
5. Distant metastasis (pM): pMX, which means the presence or absence of distant metastases is unknown.

Based on the above information, we can determine the T, N, and M stages as follows:

* T stage: T2 (tumor measures 3.5 cm and invades into the pleura)
* N stage: NX (lymph node status is unknown)
* M stage: MX (distant metastasis status is unknown)

According to the AJCC staging system, a T2 tumor with unknown lymph node and distant metastasis status corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
35,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions ""Pathologic stage is T2N0MX"". This indicates that the tumor is classified as T2 (tumor size >2 cm but â‰¤5 cm), N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis), and MX (distant metastasis cannot be assessed).

2. The tumor size is 2.8 cm, which falls within the T2 category.

3. There is no lymph node involvement (N0), as all sampled lymph nodes are benign.

4. There is no mention of distant metastasis, so MX is assigned.

5. According to the AJCC staging system, a T2N0MX classification corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
36,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor site is in the middle lobe of the right lung, and the maximum tumor size is 5.5 x 5.0 cm, which is a significant size.
2. The histologic type is non-small cell carcinoma, and the grade is G3, poorly differentiated.
3. There is no visceral pleural invasion, but the tumor extends into the fissure.
4. The bronchial margin is negative for tumor, and there is no squamous cell carcinoma in situ identified.
5. The vascular parenchymal parietal pleural margins are all negative for carcinoma.
6. Lymph vascular invasion is indeterminate but favors present in block 4.
7. Twelve lymph nodes were examined, including parts A through E, and block F1, which is negative for carcinoma.
8. The pathologic stage is reported as pT2, which corresponds to a tumor size > 3 cm but â‰¤ 5 cm.
9. There is no mention of distant metastases (M0).

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* Tumor size (pT2) corresponds to a T2 stage.
* There is no visceral pleural invasion (V0), and the tumor extends into the fissure, which does not affect the T stage.
* Lymph vascular invasion is indeterminate but favors present, which does not affect the T stage.
* Twelve lymph nodes were examined, and none showed carcinoma, which corresponds to an N0 stage.
* There is no mention of distant metastases (M0).

Therefore, the AJCC stage is T2N0M0, which corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
37,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the right lung, and its size is 7 cm (mentioned in the final diagnosis of the right lung, pneumonectomy).
2. There is no invasion of the visceral pleura (mentioned in the final diagnosis of the right lung, pneumonectomy).
3. The bronchial and vascular margins are negative (mentioned in the final diagnosis of the right lung, pneumonectomy).
4. There is no tumor seen in the lymph nodes of levels 4, 7, and 9 (mentioned in the final diagnosis of the corresponding lymph nodes).
5. However, the tumor has metastasized to the rib (portion of sixth rib, excision), which is a distant metastasis.

According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a size of 7 cm, no invasion of the visceral pleura, and negative margins is classified as T2. The absence of tumor in the lymph nodes of levels 4, 7, and 9 indicates N0. The presence of a distant metastasis in the rib (M1) takes precedence over the T and N classifications.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IV}"
38,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Primary tumor (pT): The report states that the tumor size is 3.5 cm, which corresponds to a pT2a classification (tumor more than 3 cm but 5 cm or less).

2. Regional lymph nodes (pN): The report indicates that there is metastatic carcinoma in 3 of 18 lymph nodes, which corresponds to a pN1 classification (metastasis in ipsilateral peribronchial lymph nodes).

3. Distant metastasis (pM): There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so we can assume pM0 (no distant metastasis).

Based on the AJCC staging system, a pT2a primary tumor, pN1 regional lymph nodes, and pM0 distant metastasis correspond to Stage IIA.

However, the report also mentions that the metastatic carcinoma is in ipsilateral peribronchial lymph nodes, which is a characteristic of Stage IIA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IIA}"
