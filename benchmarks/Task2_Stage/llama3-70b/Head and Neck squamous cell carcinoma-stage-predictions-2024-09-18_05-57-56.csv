To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the primary tumor (T), lymph node involvement (N), and distant metastasis (M).

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The primary tumor (T) is classified as pT4a, which means the tumor has invaded the hyoid bone and/or thyroid cartilage, and/or has invaded the laryngeal cartilage and/or has extrinsic muscle invasion.
* Lymph node involvement (N) is classified as pN2c, which means there are multiple lymph nodes involved on both sides of the neck, with at least one node larger than 3 cm in greatest dimension.
* There is no evidence of distant metastasis (M), so M is classified as pMx (unknown).

Based on the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a pT4a primary tumor, pN2c lymph node involvement, and pMx distant metastasis would correspond to Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is:

{""stage"" : Stage IV}"
1,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions ""POORLY DIFFERENTIATED SQUAMOUS CARCINOMA INVADING BONE"" in the anterior mandible, which indicates that the tumor has invaded the bone.

2. The report also mentions ""LYMPHATIC AND PERINEURAL INVASION FLOOR OF MOUTH"" and ""TUMOR CLOSE TO MARGIN OF RESECTION"", which suggests that the tumor has invaded the floor of the mouth and is close to the resection margin.

3. However, the report states that the bone margins of resection are free of tumor, and the soft tissue margins are also free of tumor, except for the anterior mucosal margin which has been disrupted.

4. The report does not mention any lymph node involvement, as five lymph nodes were examined and no tumor was found.

5. Based on the above information, we can determine the T stage of the tumor. Since the tumor has invaded the bone and the floor of the mouth, and is close to the resection margin, the T stage is likely T4.

6. Since there is no lymph node involvement, the N stage is N0.

7. There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report, so the M stage is M0.

8. Based on the TNM staging system, a T4N0M0 tumor corresponds to Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IV}"
2,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size (T), regional lymph nodes (N), and distant metastasis (M).

From the pathology report, we can extract the following information:

* Tumor size (T): The tumor is 4 cm in greatest dimension, which corresponds to T2 (tumor more than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension).
* Regional lymph nodes (N): There are metastases in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes (pN2b), with focal extranodal extension.
* Distant metastasis (M): There is no evidence of distant metastasis (pMX: cannot be assessed).

Based on the AJCC staging system, the T2 tumor and pN2b lymph nodes correspond to Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IV}"
3,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC Stage of the cancer.

First, we need to identify the primary tumor (T) stage. The report states that the tumor is 1.9 cm in size, and there is no angiolymphatic invasion or perineural invasion. The surgical margins are 1.6 mm to the deep margin and 3 mm to the medial margin, with the remaining margins >1 cm. Based on this information, the primary tumor (T) stage is T1.

Next, we need to determine the nodal (N) stage. The report states that 24 lymph nodes are negative for carcinoma (0/24), and there is no evidence of metastatic carcinoma in the lymph nodes. Therefore, the nodal (N) stage is N0.

Finally, we need to determine the metastasis (M) stage. There is no evidence of distant metastasis in the report, so the metastasis (M) stage is M0.

Based on the T, N, and M stages, we can determine the overall AJCC Stage of the cancer. According to the AJCC staging system, a T1N0M0 corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
4,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (pT)**: The report states that the tumor is 3.5 cm in greatest dimension, which corresponds to pT2 (Tumor more than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension).
2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN)**: The report indicates that there is no regional lymph node metastasis (pN0), as 27 lymph nodes were examined and none were involved.
3. **Distant Metastasis (pM)**: There is no mention of distant metastasis, so pM0.

Based on the AJCC staging system, the stage is determined by the combination of pT, pN, and pM. In this case, we have:

* pT2 (tumor size 3.5 cm)
* pN0 (no lymph node metastasis)
* pM0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC staging system, this corresponds to **Stage II**.

Therefore, the answer is:
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
5,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions ""pT2"", which indicates the primary tumor is of size 2.6 x 2.6 x 1.0 cm, invading the subglottal and supraglottal regions. According to the AJCC staging system, a T2 tumor is larger than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension, and may involve the supraglottis and/or glottis and/or subglottis.

2. The report also mentions ""pNO"", which indicates there is no evidence of regional lymph node metastasis.

3. There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report.

Based on the above information, the tumor is classified as T2N0M0, which corresponds to Stage II according to the AJCC staging system.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
6,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary tumor (T)**: The tumor size is 5.0 x 3.0 cm, and it invades the anterior space, thyroid cartilage, and epiglottic cartilage with extensive perineural invasion. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual, this corresponds to T4a (tumor invades thyroid cartilage, trachea, cricoid cartilage, or cervical esophagus).

2. **Lymph nodes (N)**: There are 5/42 positive lymph nodes on the left side, with macrometastasis (size of large metastatic focus 2.2 cm) and no extracapsular extension. This corresponds to N2b (metastasis in multiple lymph nodes, none larger than 6 cm).

3. **Distant metastasis (M)**: There is no evidence of distant metastasis in the report.

Based on the above, the AJCC stage is determined by combining the T, N, and M categories. In this case, the stage is T4a, N2b, M0.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual, the corresponding stage is **Stage IV**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IV}"
7,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Tumor size and extent**: The tumor size is 4 x 2 cm, which is a significant size. The tumor extent is described as involving the deep muscles of the tongue, which suggests a T3 tumor (T3: Tumor > 4 cm or tumor invades adjacent structures).

2. **Lymph node involvement**: The report mentions that 1/4 of the lymph nodes are positive for metastasis, specifically in the cervical region. This indicates N1 disease (N1: Metastasis in a single ipsilateral lymph node, ≤ 3 cm in greatest dimension).

3. **Margins and neo-adjuvant treatment**: The margins are uninvolved, and there is no evidence of neo-adjuvant treatment.

Considering the above factors, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* Tumor size and extent: T3
* Lymph node involvement: N1
* Metastasis: Not mentioned (M0)
* Therefore, the AJCC stage is Stage III (T3N1M0).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
8,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The tumor size is 5.5 cm, which corresponds to T3 (tumor more than 4 cm in greatest dimension).
* There is metastasis in bilateral lymph nodes (levels I, II, and III on the left side and levels II and III on the right side), with extranodal invasion present. This corresponds to N2c (metastasis in bilateral or contralateral lymph nodes, none more than 6 cm in greatest dimension).
* There is no distant metastasis (pMX: Distant metastasis cannot be assessed).

Based on the TNM classification, the AJCC stage is determined by combining the T, N, and M categories. In this case, the stage is:

T3 (tumor more than 4 cm in greatest dimension)
N2c (metastasis in bilateral or contralateral lymph nodes, none more than 6 cm in greatest dimension)
M0 (no distant metastasis)

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary tumor (T)**: The report describes a 4.5 cm invasive moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the pharynx, left posterior wall, with lymphovascular invasion. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual, this corresponds to a T3 tumor (tumor > 4 cm in greatest dimension).

2. **Regional lymph nodes (N)**: The report mentions metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in 1 of 10 right cervical lymph nodes (1/6 level I) and 5 of 10 left cervical lymph nodes (2/3 level I, 1/3 level II, 2/4 level III). This indicates multiple ipsilateral and contralateral lymph node involvement. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual, this corresponds to an N3 lymph node status (metastasis in 4 or more lymph nodes, or any lymph node > 6 cm in greatest dimension).

3. **Distant metastasis (M)**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the report.

Considering the T3 primary tumor and N3 lymph node status, the AJCC stage of the cancer is Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IV}"
11,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and metastasis.

From the pathology report, we know that the tumor size is 5.0 cm (greatest dimension), which corresponds to T4 (tumor invades adjacent structures, such as skeletal muscle, salivary glands, etc.).

The lymph node involvement is significant, with metastatic carcinoma present in four of 35 lymph nodes, including level IIA, III, and IV nodes. The largest positive node is 2.5 cm (level III), and three other positive nodes are approximately 1.5 cm, 1.2 cm, and 1.1 cm. Moreover, both level III nodes and the level IIA node have extracapsular extension, which is a critical factor in determining the N stage. This corresponds to N2b (metastasis in multiple lymph nodes, including level III and IV nodes, with extracapsular extension).

There is no evidence of distant metastasis (M0).

According to the AJCC staging system, a T4 tumor with N2b lymph node involvement and no distant metastasis corresponds to Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is -

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (T)**: The tumor size is 1 x 0 x 1.5 cm, which is relatively small. The tumor is localized to the larynx, and there is no mention of extension to surrounding structures. Therefore, the T stage is likely T1 or T2.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N)**: There is no mention of lymph nodes in the pathology report, which suggests that they were not examined or were not involved. Therefore, the N stage is likely N0.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the pathology report.

Based on the above analysis, the AJCC stage is likely Stage I or Stage II, as the tumor is localized to the larynx, and there is no evidence of lymph node involvement or distant metastasis.

However, the report mentions that ""Endoscopies, figrolaryngoscopy show cancer of the larynx with the involvement of all parts of the organ."" This suggests that the tumor may be more extensive than initially thought, and the T stage could be T3.

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, I will carefully review the pathology report and extract the relevant information.

First, I note that the patient has invasive squamous cell carcinoma in both the right and left aryepiglottic folds, which suggests that the tumor is bilateral.

The report also mentions that the tumor is extending into adjacent cartilage in the left aryepiglottic fold, which indicates that the tumor has invaded the cartilage.

According to the AJCC staging system, the primary tumor (T) is classified as T3 if the tumor invades the cartilage or bone. Since the tumor has invaded the cartilage, I would classify the primary tumor as T3.

There is no mention of lymph node involvement or distant metastases in the report, so I would assume that the lymph node status (N) is N0 and the metastasis status (M) is M0.

Based on the T3N0M0 classification, I would determine the AJCC stage of the cancer as Stage III.

There is no distant metastasis mentioned in the report, so pM0.

**AJCC Stage:**
Based on the above, the AJCC stage is Stage III (pT2 N2b M0).

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions ""SQUAMOUS CARCINOMA, MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED"" which indicates the type and grade of the tumor.

2. The tumor size is 2.6 x 2.2 x 2.1 cm, which is larger than 2 cm but smaller than 4 cm. According to the AJCC staging system, this corresponds to a T2 tumor.

3. The report states ""TUMOR EXTENDS TO RIGHT LINGUAL SURGICAL RESECTION MARGIN"" which indicates that the tumor has invaded the mandible (bone) and has also extended to the surgical resection margin.

4. However, the subsequent report mentions that the resection margins are free of tumor, which suggests that the tumor has been completely resected.

5. There is no mention of lymph node involvement or distant metastasis in the report.

Based on these findings, the tumor can be staged as T2 (due to the size) and N0 (no lymph node involvement) and M0 (no distant metastasis). According to the AJCC staging system, this corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

From the report, we know that the patient has a squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, specifically in the supraglottic region. The tumor size is 4.5 cm, and it has invaded the thyroid cartilage.

The report also mentions that there is perineural invasion and angiolymphatic invasion present. Additionally, one of the 56 lymph nodes examined is positive for metastatic disease, which is located in the right level 3 lymph node.

The surgical margins of resection are free of tumor, which is a good prognostic factor.

Using the AJCC staging system, we can determine the stage as follows:

* T stage: The tumor is classified as T4a because it has invaded the thyroid cartilage.
* N stage: The presence of a single positive lymph node in the right level 3 lymph node corresponds to an N2a stage.
* M stage: There is no evidence of distant metastases, so the M stage is MX.

Therefore, the overall stage of the cancer is Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IV}"
36,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The tumor size is 3.5 cm in greatest dimension, which corresponds to T2 (tumor > 2 cm but ≤ 4 cm).
* There is metastatic carcinoma to one of 26 lymph nodes (1/11 level II lymph nodes and 0/15 level III lymph nodes), which corresponds to N1 (metastasis to a single ipsilateral lymph node, ≤ 3 cm).
* There is no evidence of distant metastasis (M0).

According to the AJCC staging manual, 6th edition, 2002, the minimal pTNM classification is pT2, pN1, pMx, which corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is an invasive, moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, with a size of 2.0 X 1.5 cm on the surface and 1.2 cm in depth.
2. The tumor has focal perineural invasion, but all margins are free of tumor.
3. There is metastatic squamous cell carcinoma present in 1 of 2 lymph nodes in the left modified neck dissection.
4. There is no tumor present in the thyroid, skin, or bone.

Based on the AJCC staging system, the primary tumor (T) is classified as T2, as it is larger than 2 cm but not larger than 4 cm. The presence of metastasis in a single lymph node (N1) and no distant metastasis (M0) indicates that the overall stage is Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
38,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the primary tumor (pT), regional lymph nodes (pN), and distant metastasis (pM).

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The primary tumor (pT) is classified as pT3, as it measures more than 4 cm in greatest dimension.
* The regional lymph nodes (pN) are classified as pN2b, as there are metastases in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes, none more than 6 cm in greatest dimension.
* There is no distant metastasis (pM).

According to the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 7th edition, 2010, the stage is determined by the combination of pT, pN, and pM. In this case, the stage is:

* pT3 (primary tumor)
* pN2b (regional lymph nodes)
* pM0 (no distant metastasis)

Therefore, the AJCC stage of the cancer is Stage III.

39,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the primary tumor (pT), regional lymph nodes (pN), and distant metastasis (pM).

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The primary tumor (pT) is classified as pT4a, which indicates that the tumor has invaded the bone (mandible).
* The regional lymph nodes (pN) are classified as pNO, which means that none of the 44 regional lymph nodes examined were involved by tumor.
* The distant metastasis (pM) is classified as pMX, which means that the presence or absence of distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Based on the AJCC staging system, a pT4a primary tumor with no regional lymph node involvement (pNO) and unknown distant metastasis (pMX) corresponds to Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IV}"

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Primary Tumor (T)**: The tumor size is 5 cm, which corresponds to T2 according to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual for oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (T2: tumor > 2 cm but ≤ 4 cm in greatest dimension).

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N)**: Six lymph nodes were examined, and all had normal morphological structure, indicating no lymph node metastasis (N0).

3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: There is no mention of distant metastasis in the pathology report, so we can assume M0.

Now, let's combine the T, N, and M categories to determine the overall stage.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual, a T2N0M0 corresponds to **Stage II**.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions ""INVASIVE POORLY DIFFERENTIATED SQUAMOUS CARCINOMA"" in the mandible, which indicates a primary tumor (T) with a high degree of malignancy.
2. The tumor size is not explicitly stated, but we can infer that it is larger than 4 cm based on the description of the lesion (1.5 cm ulcerated, raised, and roughened) and the fact that it extends to the anterior gingival surface of the posterior sixth and fifth tooth.
3. The report mentions ""PERINEURAL INVASION"" and ""QUESTIONABLE LYMPHATICS,"" which suggests that the tumor may have invaded nearby nerves and possibly lymphatic vessels.
4. There is no evidence of distant metastases (M) mentioned in the report.
5. The report does not provide information about the number of lymph nodes involved (N), but it does mention that the margins of resection are free of tumor.

Based on the above information, we can assign the following AJCC stage components:

* T: T4 (primary tumor is larger than 4 cm and invades nearby structures, such as bone)
* N: Nx (lymph node status is unknown)
* M: M0 (no distant metastases)

According to the AJCC staging system, a T4 tumor with unknown lymph node status and no distant metastases corresponds to Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IV}"

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the right tongue, and it measures 5.0 cm in greatest dimension (pT4a).
2. The tumor has invaded the deep tongue muscles but not the mandible.
3. All margins are negative, with the closest margin (posterior) being 0.6 cm.
4. There is no lymph node involvement (pNo).

According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a size greater than 4 cm (pT4a) and no lymph node involvement (pNo) corresponds to Stage IVA.

Therefore, the answer is -
{""stage"" : Stage IVA}"

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is an invasive squamous cell carcinoma located in the left partial glossectomy specimen, with a size of 3.4 cm in largest dimension and a depth of invasion of 1.4 cm.
2. The tumor has an infiltrative border with thick cords > 4 cells, and perineural invasion is present, but vascular invasion is absent.
3. The mucosal margin is negative for invasive carcinoma, and the deep margin is also negative for invasive carcinoma. However, there is severe dysplasia at the posterolateral margin.
4. The lymph nodes from levels I, II, III, and IV are all negative for tumor (0/6, 0/10, 0/18, and 0/9, respectively).

Based on the TNM staging system, the primary tumor is classified as T2 (size > 2 cm but ≤ 4 cm) and N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis).

Therefore, the AJCC stage of the cancer is Stage II.
