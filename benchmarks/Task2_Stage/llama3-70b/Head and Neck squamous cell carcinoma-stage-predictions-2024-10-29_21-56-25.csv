To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor (T), node (N), and metastasis (M) components.

The tumor (T) component is classified as pT4a, which indicates that the tumor has invaded the epiglottic cartilage and the hyoid bone.

The node (N) component is classified as pN2c, which indicates that there are multiple lymph nodes involved on both sides of the neck, with the largest node measuring 3.2 cm in greatest dimension.

The metastasis (M) component is classified as pMx, which indicates that there is no distant metastasis.

Based on the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a pT4a classification and a pN2c classification would correspond to Stage IV. However, since there is no distant metastasis (pMx), the final stage would be Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
1,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The diagnosis is poorly differentiated squamous carcinoma invading bone, with lymphatic and perineural invasion in the floor of mouth.
2. The tumor is close to the margin of resection, but the bone margins are free of tumor.
3. There is no tumor in the five lymph nodes examined.
4. The tumor size is not explicitly stated, but the exophytic area in the floor of mouth measures 4.0 X 3.5 X 3.0 cm.

Based on the AJCC staging system, the primary tumor (T) is classified as T4 due to bone invasion. The absence of lymph node metastasis (N0) and the lack of distant metastasis (M0) are also noted.

According to the AJCC staging system, a T4N0M0 classification corresponds to Stage IVA.

However, since the options provided do not include Stage IVA, we need to consider the closest match. Stage III typically corresponds to T1-3N1M0 or T4N0-1M0. Given the T4 classification and N0 status, Stage III is the most appropriate match.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
2,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size (T), regional lymph nodes (N), and distant metastasis (M).

From the pathology report, we can extract the following information:

* Tumor size (T): The tumor is 4 cm in greatest dimension, which corresponds to T2 (Tumor more than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension).
* Regional lymph nodes (N): There are metastases in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes (pN2b), with 3 out of 51 nodes involved, and focal extranodal extension is present.
* Distant metastasis (M): The report states pMX, which means distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

Based on the TNM classification, the patient has a T2 tumor, N2b regional lymph nodes, and MX distant metastasis.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual, a T2N2bMX corresponds to Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IV}"
3,"## Answer

1. The primary tumor is located in the right tongue, and its size is 1.9 cm (pT1).
2. There is no angiolymphatic invasion, perineural invasion, or bone invasion.
3. The surgical margins are clear, with a minimum distance of 1.6 mm to the deep margin and 3 mm to the medial margin.
4. Carcinoma in situ is present.
5. There are 24 lymph nodes examined, and none of them show metastatic carcinoma (pN0).

Based on the above information, the AJCC Pathologic Stage is pT1 pN0.

According to the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, a pT1 tumor with no lymph node involvement (pN0) corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
4,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the primary tumor (pT), regional lymph nodes (pN), and distant metastasis (pM).

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The primary tumor (pT) is classified as pT2, which means the tumor is more than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension.
* There is no regional lymph node metastasis (pN0), as 27 lymph nodes were examined and none were involved.
* There is no distant metastasis (pM) mentioned in the report.

5,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions ""pT2"", which indicates the primary tumor (T) is of size 2.6 x 2.6 x 1.0 cm, invading the subglottal and supraglottal regions. According to the AJCC staging system, a T2 tumor is larger than 1 cm but not more than 2 cm in greatest dimension, and may involve the supraglottis and/or glottis and/or subglottis.

2. The report also mentions ""pNO (Delphian)"", which indicates there is no regional lymph node metastasis (N0).

3. There is no mention of distant metastasis (M) in the report.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* T2 (primary tumor size and invasion)
* N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis)
* M0 (no distant metastasis, assumed since not mentioned)

According to the AJCC staging system, a T2N0M0 corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
6,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The tumor size is 5.0 x 3.0 cm, which corresponds to T3 (tumor > 4 cm or invades the larynx).
* The tumor invades the anterior space, epiglottis, and thyroid cartilage, which also supports a T3 classification.
* There is lymphovascular permeation present, which is a high-risk feature.
* The left modified radical neck dissection shows 5/42 positive lymph nodes, with the largest metastatic focus measuring 2.2 cm. This corresponds to N2b (multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes, none > 6 cm).
* There is no evidence of distant metastasis (M0).

Based on the TNM classification, the patient has a T3N2bM0 tumor. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, this corresponds to Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is -

7,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. **Tumor size and extent**: The tumor size is 4 x 2 cm, which is a significant size. The tumor extent is described as involving the deep muscles of the tongue, which suggests a T3 tumor (T3: Tumor > 4 cm or invades adjacent structures).

2. **Lymph node involvement**: The report mentions that 1/4 of the lymph nodes are positive for metastasis, specifically in the cervical region (Cervical 1/4). This indicates N1 nodal involvement (N1: Metastasis in a single ipsilateral lymph node, ≤ 3 cm in greatest dimension).

3. **Margins and neo-adjuvant treatment**: The margins are uninvolved, and there is no evidence of neo-adjuvant treatment.

Considering the above factors, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* Tumor (T): T3 (tumor > 4 cm or invades adjacent structures)
* Node (N): N1 (metastasis in a single ipsilateral lymph node, ≤ 3 cm in greatest dimension)
* Metastasis (M): Not mentioned, so assumed to be M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC staging system, a T3N1M0 corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
8,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The tumor size is 5.5 cm, which corresponds to a T3 tumor (pT3: Tumor or lip or oral cavity more than 4 cm in greatest dimension).
* There is lymph node involvement in both the left and right neck, with a total of 8 involved lymph nodes out of 59 examined. The largest involved lymph node measures 3.1 cm, and extranodal invasion is present. This corresponds to an N2c lymph node status (pN2c: Metastasis in bilateral or contralateral lymph nodes, none more than 6 cm in greatest dimension for all aerodigestive sites except nasopharynx).
* There is no distant metastasis (pMX: Distant metastasis cannot be assessed).

Based on the TNM staging system, a T3 tumor with N2c lymph node involvement corresponds to a Stage III cancer.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
9,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is located in the right pyriform sinus, measuring 3.5 x 1.5 x 1.1 cm, and involves the lateral wall of the larynx without bone invasion. This corresponds to a T2 tumor (tumor > 2 cm but ≤ 4 cm in greatest dimension).
2. The report mentions metastatic squamous carcinoma in multiple lymph nodes on both sides of the neck, including levels II, III, and IV. This indicates nodal involvement, specifically N3 (metastasis in lymph nodes > 6 cm in greatest dimension).
3. There is no evidence of distant metastasis (M0) in the report.

According to the AJCC staging system, a T2 tumor with N3 nodal involvement and no distant metastasis corresponds to Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IV}"
10,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can gather the following information:

* The tumor size is 4.5 cm, which corresponds to T2 (Tumor > 2 cm but ≤ 4 cm in greatest dimension).
* There is lymphovascular invasion, which is not a factor in staging.
* There are two peritumoral deposits of squamous cell carcinoma, possibly representing two completely replaced lymph nodes. This is considered N2b (Metastasis in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes).
* There is metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in 1 of 10 right cervical lymph nodes and 5 of 10 left cervical lymph nodes, which is also consistent with N2b.

Since there is no mention of distant metastasis, the M category is M0 (No distant metastasis).

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system for pharyngeal cancer, a T2 tumor with N2b lymph node involvement and M0 distant metastasis corresponds to Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
11,"## Answer

The patient's pathology report indicates that the tumor has invaded the salivary glands and skeletal muscle, and has also metastasized to four lymph nodes (level IIA, III, and IV). The largest positive node is 2.5 cm in size, and three other positive nodes are approximately 1.5 cm, 1.2 cm, and 1.1 cm in size. Additionally, the report mentions that the carcinoma is extensively present at the cauterized superior aspect of the lateral surgical margin, focally at the cauterized posterior margin, closely approaching the inferolateral margin, and less than 0.1 cm to the medial uvula margin.

Based on the AJCC 2002 staging system, the minimum pathologic stage is pT4aN2bMX. The ""pT4a"" indicates that the tumor has invaded the adjacent structures (salivary glands and skeletal muscle), and the ""N2b"" indicates that there are multiple lymph nodes involved (four in this case), with at least one node larger than 3 cm in size. The ""MX"" indicates that the presence of distant metastases cannot be assessed.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IV}"
12,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report indicates that the patient has invasive squamous cell carcinoma in both the right and left aryepiglottic folds of the larynx, which suggests that the tumor is bilateral.
2. The tumor in the left aryepiglottic fold is extending into adjacent cartilage, which implies that the tumor has invaded the cartilage.
3. There is no mention of lymph node involvement or distant metastases in the report.
4. According to the AJCC staging system for laryngeal cancer, the primary tumor (T) is classified as T3 because it has invaded the cartilage.
5. Since the tumor is bilateral, it is considered a single tumor, and the N (lymph node) classification is N0, as there is no evidence of lymph node involvement.
6. The M (distant metastasis) classification is M0, as there is no evidence of distant metastases.

Based on the T3N0M0 classification, the AJCC stage of the cancer is Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
18,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size and depth of invasion (T), lymph node involvement (N), and distant metastasis (M).

From the pathology report, we can extract the following information:

* Tumor size: 1 cm
* Depth of invasion: 0.5 cm
* Lymph node involvement: No metastatic squamous cell carcinoma identified in any of the lymph nodes (Sentinel lymph nodes #1 and #2, and lymph nodes #3 and #4)

According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor size of 1 cm with a depth of invasion of 0.5 cm corresponds to a T1 classification. The absence of lymph node involvement corresponds to an N0 classification. There is no mention of distant metastasis, so the M classification is M0.

Therefore, the AJCC pathologic stage is T1, N0, M0, which corresponds to Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
19,"## Answer

The patient's pathology report indicates that the primary tumor (pT) is classified as pT2, which means the tumor is larger than 2 cm but not larger than 4 cm. The regional lymph nodes (pN) are classified as pN1, which means there is metastasis to a single ipsilateral lymph node, and the largest focus measures 2.4 cm. There is no distant metastasis (pM0). 

The report also mentions perineural invasion, which is a poor prognostic factor. However, it does not affect the staging. 

According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a pT2 classification, pN1 classification, and pM0 classification corresponds to Stage III. 

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"

24,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size, invasion, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The tumor size is 2.5 cm in largest dimension, which corresponds to T2 (Tumor > 2 cm but ≤ 4 cm).
* The tumor invades the bone (mandible), which is a critical factor in determining the T stage. This corresponds to T4 (Tumor invades adjacent structures, such as cortical bone, inferior alveolar nerve, floor of mouth, or skin of face).
* There is no lymph node involvement, as all lymph nodes examined are negative for tumor (0/11, 0/2, 0/1, etc.).
* There is no mention of distant metastasis.

Based on these findings, the AJCC stage of the cancer is:

T4 (Tumor invades adjacent structures, such as cortical bone) + N0 (No lymph node involvement) + M0 (No distant metastasis) = Stage IV.

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. Primary tumor (T): The tumor measures 5.0 x 3.8 x 3.0 cm and extends to within 3.0 mm of the medial/inferior soft tissue margin. It obliterates the gingival-buccal sulcus and the floor of the mouth. This suggests a large tumor that has invaded the mandible and extended to the skin and deep dermis. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual, this would correspond to a T4a tumor, which is a tumor that invades the cortical bone, inferior alveolar nerve, floor of the mouth, or skin of the face.

2. Regional lymph nodes (N): The pathology report indicates that 22 lymph nodes were examined, and none of them showed evidence of metastatic disease. This suggests that the regional lymph nodes are negative for cancer, which corresponds to an N0 classification.

3. Distant metastasis (M): There is no mention of distant metastasis in the pathology report, which suggests that the cancer has not spread to distant organs or tissues. This corresponds to an M0 classification.

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor's characteristics, lymph node involvement, and metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can gather the following information:

* The tumor is an invasive squamous cell carcinoma, keratinizing type, moderately differentiated, with a maximum dimension of 2.1 cm.
* The tumor involves the left and right supraglottis, with transglottic extension to the left and right true vocal cords.
* The tumor also involves the pre-epiglottic and paraglottic spaces, with thyroid cartilage invasion.
* Angiolymphatic invasion is present, but perineural invasion is not present.
* The surgical margins are free of tumor.

Regarding lymph node involvement:

* Micrometastatic squamous cell carcinoma is present in one of 25 lymph nodes on the left side (<0.1 cm).
* Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma is present in two of 14 lymph nodes on the right side (0.5 cm).
* There is no extracapsular spread.

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* T stage: pT4a (tumor invades the thyroid cartilage and/or invades tissues beyond the larynx)
* N stage: pN2c (metastasis in multiple lymph nodes on both sides of the neck, with no extracapsular spread)

2. Tumor size: 5.5 cm - This is a significant size, but we need to consider other factors to determine the T stage.
3. Ulceration: present - This is a negative prognostic factor.
4. Mucosa, cartilage plan, and skeletal muscle invasion - This indicates the tumor has invaded local structures, which is a T4a factor.
5. Lymphatic invasion: present - This is a negative prognostic factor.
6. Metastasis in two lymph nodes without capsular involvement among eleven lymph nodes (2/11) - This indicates N2b disease, as there are multiple lymph nodes involved on the same side of the neck as the primary tumor.
7. No distant metastases are mentioned in the report.

Based on the above factors, we can determine the TNM stages as follows:

* T stage: T4a (due to invasion of local structures)
* N stage: N2b (due to multiple lymph nodes involved on the same side of the neck as the primary tumor)
* M stage: M0 (no distant metastases)

2. The tumor invades the mandible, which is a deep tissue structure. This is considered a T4a tumor, which takes precedence over the T2 size classification.
3. The tumor extends to the right lingual surgical resection margin, but the supplemental report shows that the resection margins are free of tumor.
4. There is no mention of lymph node involvement or distant metastases in the report.

Based on these findings, the tumor is classified as T4aN0M0.

According to the AJCC staging system, a T4aN0M0 tumor corresponds to Stage IVA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IVA}"
35,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to analyze the pathology report and identify the key features that correspond to the TNM staging system.

From the report, we can extract the following information:

* Primary tumor (T): The tumor is located in the supraglottis and pyriform sinus, extending into the thyroid cartilage, with a maximum dimension of 4.5 cm. This corresponds to a T4a classification, as the tumor has invaded the thyroid cartilage.
* Regional lymph nodes (N): There is one positive lymph node out of 56 examined, located in the right level 3, measuring 3.1 cm. This corresponds to an N2a classification, as there is a single ipsilateral lymph node larger than 3 cm.
* Distant metastases (M): There is no evidence of distant metastases, so the M stage is MX.

Based on the TNM staging system, the AJCC stage of the cancer is:

* T4a (primary tumor)
* N2a (regional lymph nodes)
* MX (distant metastases)

According to the AJCC staging manual, this corresponds to Stage IV.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IV}"
36,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor size (T), lymph node involvement (N), and distant metastasis (M).

From the pathology report, we can gather the following information:

* Tumor size (T): The tumor measures 3.5 cm in greatest dimension, which corresponds to a T2 classification (T2: tumor > 2 cm but ≤ 4 cm in greatest dimension).
* Lymph node involvement (N): There is metastatic carcinoma in one of 26 lymph nodes (1/11 level II lymph nodes and 0/15 level III lymph nodes), which corresponds to an N1 classification (N1: metastasis in a single ipsilateral lymph node, ≤ 3 cm in greatest dimension).
* Distant metastasis (M): There is no evidence of distant metastasis, which corresponds to an M0 classification (M0: no distant metastasis).

According to the AJCC staging manual (6th edition, 2002), the minimal pTNM classification is pT2, pN1, pMx. Based on this classification, the AJCC stage is Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
37,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the tumor's primary site, size, invasion, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis.

From the pathology report, we can identify the following key features:

1. Primary site: The tumor is located in the tongue (left partial glossectomy and pharyngectomy).
2. Tumor size: The tumor measures 2.0 X 1.5 cm on the surface and 1.2 cm in depth.
3. Invasion: The tumor shows focal perineural invasion.
4. Lymph node involvement: Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma is present in 1 of 2 lymph nodes.
5. Distant metastasis: There is no evidence of distant metastasis.

Based on the AJCC staging system for oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma, we can assign the following stage:

* Tumor (T): T2 (tumor is >2 cm but ≤4 cm in greatest dimension)
* Node (N): N1 (metastasis in a single ipsilateral lymph node, ≤3 cm in greatest dimension)
* Metastasis (M): M0 (no distant metastasis)

Therefore, the AJCC stage is Stage III.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage III""}"
38,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the primary tumor (pT), regional lymph nodes (pN), and distant metastasis (pM).

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The primary tumor (pT) is classified as pT3, as it measures more than 4 cm in greatest dimension.
* The regional lymph nodes (pN) are classified as pN2b, as there are metastases in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes, none more than 6 cm in greatest dimension.
* There is no distant metastasis (pM).

According to the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 7th edition, 2010, the stage is determined by the combination of pT, pN, and pM. In this case, the stage is:

pT3 pN2b pM0

Therefore, the answer is:

(C) Stage III"
39,"## Answer

To determine the AJCC stage of the cancer, we need to evaluate the primary tumor (pT), regional lymph nodes (pN), and distant metastasis (pM).

From the pathology report, we can see that:

* The primary tumor (pT) is classified as pT4a, which indicates that the tumor has invaded the bone (mandible).
* The regional lymph nodes (pN) are classified as pNO, which means that no tumor is present in the 44 regional lymph nodes examined.
* The distant metastasis (pM) is classified as pMX, which means that the presence or absence of distant metastasis cannot be assessed.

According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor with a pT4a classification and no regional lymph node involvement (pNO) would be classified as Stage IVA.

Therefore, the answer is not among the options provided. The correct answer would be Stage IVA.

However, since the options are limited, we can try to find the closest match. Between the options, Stage IV is the closest match, as it indicates that the tumor has invaded the bone and/or has distant metastasis.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IV}"
40,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The tumor size is 5 cm, which is a significant factor in determining the T stage. According to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual, a tumor size of 5 cm corresponds to a T3 stage (T1: ≤2 cm, T2: >2 cm but ≤4 cm, T3: >4 cm but ≤7 cm, T4: >7 cm).

2. The tumor is localized (Tumor Extent: Localized, NOS), which suggests that it has not invaded adjacent structures. This supports the T3 stage.

3. There is no evidence of distant metastases (M0) in the report.

4. The report mentions six lymph nodes with normal morphological structure, which indicates that there is no lymph node involvement (N0).

5. Combining the T3 stage with N0 and M0, we can determine the overall stage of the cancer.

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging manual, a T3N0M0 corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
41,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions multiple biopsies and resections, including the mandible, upper lip, floor of mouth, and buccal mucosa.
2. The tumor is described as poorly differentiated squamous carcinoma in the periosteum of the mandible, with invasion into the bone.
3. The report also mentions perineural invasion and questionable lymphatics.
4. The margins of resection are free of tumor, but there is focal moderate dysplasia at the margin.
5. The tumor size is not explicitly stated, but the report describes a 1.5 cm ulcerated lesion on the buccal mucosa.

Based on the AJCC staging system, the key factors to consider are:

* Tumor size (T): The report does not provide a clear tumor size, but the 1.5 cm lesion on the buccal mucosa suggests a T2 or T3 tumor.
* Invasion (T): The tumor has invaded the bone (mandible) and has perineural invasion, which suggests a T4 tumor.
* Lymph node involvement (N): The report mentions questionable lymphatics, but there is no clear evidence of lymph node involvement.
* Distant metastases (M): There is no mention of distant metastases.

Considering these factors, the most likely stage is:

Therefore, the answer is - {""stage"" : Stage IV}"
42,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The diagnosis is moderately-differentiated invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the right tongue, with invasion into the deep tongue muscles and no invasion into the mandible.
2. The tumor size is 5.0 cm in greatest dimension, and all margins are negative.
3. There is no lymph node involvement (pNo) in 16 lymph nodes examined.
4. The tumor has invaded the deep tongue muscles, which corresponds to a T4a classification (tumor invades the deep extrinsic muscle of the tongue).

Based on the above information, we can determine the AJCC stage as follows:

* T stage: T4a (tumor invades the deep extrinsic muscle of the tongue)
* N stage: N0 (no lymph node involvement)
* M stage: M0 (no distant metastasis mentioned in the report)

According to the AJCC staging system, a T4a tumor with N0 and M0 corresponds to Stage IVA.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage IVA}"
43,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary tumor is an invasive squamous carcinoma of the left tongue (partial glossectomy), with a size of 3.4 cm in largest dimension and a depth of invasion of 1.4 cm.
2. The tumor has an infiltrative border with thick cords (> 4 cells) and moderate perineural invasion.
3. There is no vascular invasion, and lymphocyte infiltration is moderate.
4. The mucosal margin is negative for invasive carcinoma, but there is severe dysplasia at the posterolateral margin.
5. The deep margin is also negative for invasive carcinoma.
6. There is no tumor present in the left selective neck dissection (levels I-IV), with a total of 33 lymph nodes examined.

Based on the TNM staging system, we can assign the following values:

* T: T2 (tumor size > 2 cm but ≤ 4 cm)
* N: N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis)
* M: M0 (no distant metastasis)

According to the AJCC 8th edition staging system, a T2N0M0 corresponds to Stage II.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage II""}"
44,"## Answer

The patient's pathology report indicates that the tumor is an invasive squamous cell carcinoma, moderately differentiated, measuring 3.0 cm in greatest dimension, involving the bilateral inferior epiglottis and extending through the epiglottis into the pre-epiglottic space. The thyroid cartilage is not present.

The report also states that the lymph nodes are negative for malignancy, with 0/19 lymph nodes positive on the left side, 0/5 lymph nodes positive on the right side, and 0/11 lymph nodes positive in the supraglottic larynx.

Based on the TNM staging system, the primary tumor (T) is classified as T3, as it has extended through the epiglottis into the pre-epiglottic space. The lymph nodes (N) are classified as N0, as none of the lymph nodes are positive for malignancy. The metastasis (M) is classified as MX, as there is no evidence of distant metastasis.

Therefore, the AJCC stage of the cancer is Stage III (pT3, N0, MX), as indicated in the comment section of the pathology report.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : Stage III}"
