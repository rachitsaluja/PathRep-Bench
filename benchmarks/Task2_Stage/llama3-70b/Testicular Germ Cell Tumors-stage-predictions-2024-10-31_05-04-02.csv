Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions ""pT1NXMX"" which indicates the TNM staging:
   - pT1: The primary tumor is limited to the testis and epididymis, and there is no vascular invasion.
   - NX: The regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed.
   - MX: Distant metastases cannot be assessed.

2. The report does not mention any lymph node involvement or distant metastases.

3. The tumor is confined to the testis and epididymis, and there is no vascular invasion.

Considering the above points, the patient's cancer is localized to the testis and epididymis, with no evidence of lymph node involvement or distant metastases.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the cancer.

1. The report mentions a left orchidectomy, which indicates that the tumor is localized to the testis.
2. The diameter of the tumor is 6.5 cm, which is a significant size, but it doesn't necessarily affect the staging.
3. There is no angio-invasion, which means the tumor has not invaded the blood vessels.
4. There is no invasion of the rete-testis, which is a network of tiny tubes in the testis.
5. There is no invasion of the tunica albuginea, which is the fibrous covering of the testis.
6. The surgical margin of the spermatic cord is free of tumor, indicating that the tumor has not spread to the spermatic cord.

Considering these factors, the tumor appears to be localized to the testis and has not invaded any surrounding structures or vessels. According to the AJCC staging system, a tumor that is confined to the testis, without any lymph node involvement or distant metastases, is classified as Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
2,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The primary site of the cancer is the left testis, and the tumor is a yolk sac tumor with foci of embryonal carcinoma.
2. The tumor size is 8.5 x 7.0 x 6.0 cm, which is a significant size, but it doesn't directly impact the staging.
3. There is no perineural invasion or angiolymphatic invasion, which suggests that the tumor has not invaded nearby nerves or lymphatic vessels.
4. The tunica albuginea, spermatic cord, and epididymis are uninvolved by neoplasia, indicating that the tumor has not spread to these surrounding structures.
5. The margin of the spermatic cord is also uninvolved by neoplasia, which suggests that the tumor has not spread to the cord.
6. The pathologic staging is reported as pT1, which according to the AJCC staging system, corresponds to a tumor limited to the testis, without vascular invasion, and with no involvement of the epididymis or spermatic cord.

Based on these findings, the cancer is confined to the testis and has not spread to any surrounding structures or lymph nodes. Therefore, the AJCC stage of the cancer is Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
3,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC Stage of the Cancer.

1. The primary site of the cancer is the left testis, and the diagnosis is classic seminoma.
2. There is no mention of any lymph node involvement or distant metastases in the report.
3. The surgical margin is uninvolved by neoplasia, indicating that the tumor has not extended beyond the testis.
4. Since there is no evidence of lymph node involvement or distant metastases, we can rule out Stage III and Stage IV.
5. The tumor is confined to the testis, which is consistent with Stage I.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
4,"## Answer

Let's break down the pathology report step by step to determine the AJCC stage of the cancer.

1. The report indicates that the patient has a seminoma, classic type, with a tumor size of 2.4 cm.
2. Lymphovascular invasion is present, which is an important factor in staging.
3. There is no invasion into the tunica vaginalis or epididymis.
4. The spermatic cord margin is free of tumor.
5. The report does not mention any metastases to lymph nodes or distant organs.

According to the AJCC staging system, the presence of lymphovascular invasion in a testicular seminoma is classified as pT2. Since there is no evidence of metastases to lymph nodes or distant organs, the N and M categories are N0 and M0, respectively.

Therefore, the AJCC stage of the cancer is Stage I, as the tumor is limited to the testis with lymphovascular invasion, but without metastases to lymph nodes or distant organs.

Therefore, the answer is - 
{""stage"" : ""Stage I""}"
